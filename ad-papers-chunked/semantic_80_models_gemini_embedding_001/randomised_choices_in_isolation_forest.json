The original procedure suggested the choice of variable to split and split point within a variable to be done uniformly at random at each step, but this paper shows that \"clustered\" diverse outliers - oftentimes a more interesting class of outliers than others can be more easily identified by applying a non-uniformly-random choice of variables and/or thresholds. Different split guiding criteria are compared and some are found to result in significantly better outlier discrimination for certain classes of outliers.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nThe isolation forest (a.k.a. IFOREST, [14]) algorithm for anomaly detection tries to exploit the idea that outliers, by definition, are \"few and different\u201d from normal data points. The premise behind the algorithm is very intuitive: in a given distribution of data points X \u2208 R\u1d50\u02e3\u207f, if picking a variable (column) at random within the data, if one selects a value uniformly at random within the range of the data distribution for that variable and then groups observations (rows) according to whether they are greater or smaller than this threshold across the chosen variable, then outliers (anomalies) have a larger chance of ending up alone or in a smaller group when compared to normal observations.\n\nThe algorithm exploits this idea by performing recursive partitions of the data - that is, a given set or subset of points is first split according to this random choice, then at each branch or group that this division produces, the procedure is repeated again but this time considering only the points that reached this subset, and it continues doing so until each point becomes isolated (is the only point present in a given division) or until some other termination criteria is met. Under this scheme, outlier points will in expectation take fewer steps/divisions/branchings to become isolated, and thus the expected isolation depth can be used as an anomaly score for each point (the shorter, the more anomalous).\n\nFor better results, this procedure is repeated many times (suggestion in [14] was 100 times), with each different run (from here on, a \"decision tree\" or simply \"tree\") taking only a small sub-sample of the data (suggestion in [14] was to sub-sample 256 points without replacement for each tree), with the observed isolation depth for each observation averaged across trees - the set of which form a \"forest\" - and compared against the expected isolation depth if all the data were distributed uniformly at random across all dimensions.\n\nFor a more computationally efficient implementation, the procedure may be stopped before reaching isolation of every point at a given tree, since outliers can only be considered to be so if their isolation depth is below average, and thus a remainder can be extrapolated for points that reach a non-isolated node with depth greater or equal than the expected average for uniformly-random data. The expected isolation depth (and thus the extrapolated remainder) can be approximated efficiently through a closed-form formula (see [1]), resulting in a very fast procedure compared to e.g. distance-based algorithms such as LOF (\"local outlier factor\", [4]).\n\nThe isolation forest algorithm as-is has enjoyed wide success and widespread usage, achieving good results in a variety of benchmarks encompassing different types of outliers (see e.g. [5]) and usually outperforming other model classes, although some issues have been identified with the logic behind the algorithm (e.g. ", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4052, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, {"id_": "73804e38-7443-40e3-8ed7-f6abe8bd0997", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests", "authors": "Cortes et al.", "year": 2021, "file_path": "ad-papers-pdf/randomised_choices_in_isolation_forest.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4117392f-c0f8-428c-b921-3a5094fb81c1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"title": "Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests", "authors": "Cortes et al.", "year": 2021, "file_path": "ad-papers-pdf/randomised_choices_in_isolation_forest.pdf"}, "hash": "44f69844255901cb18ca7eaf5964bbb2d6cda1a8720d0d00f656c3406f74c87d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5d8c38ad-8d3f-44a4-bff8-07d4b0f740d6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"title": "Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests", "authors": "Cortes et al.", "year": 2021, "file_path": "ad-papers-pdf/randomised_choices_in_isolation_forest.pdf"}, "hash": "85720a5ec2ef2649b2bf6fcea2b5e0a338fba9cdddfd2075aa4083077385cd1b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3c6af40a-3209-436a-aac8-92b1bd4dd702", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "be7417a4f9e8bfe04b3b7367cd032e61344835d7d48dca710250bb16bea49be2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "in [2]).

This work tries to characterize these cases and proposes a different guiding heuristic for split selection in IFOREST, which is compared against similar ideas and found to outperform them in datasets in which isolation-based methods dominate others, at the expense of hindered performance in datasets in which non-tree-based methods outperform IFOREST.\n\n## 2 Related work\n\nThere are many potential ways in which the isolation forest procedure can be improved upon while following the same core concept behind it. For example, [12] highlights biases that are introduced by the way that data splits are created and shows some simple ways in which the procedure can fail to produce adequate results, proposing a simple fix (the \"extended isolation forest\" algorithm or EIF) which, instead of producing splits by one variable at a time (or \"axis-parallel splits\u201d), produces split thresholds with respect to randomly-generated hyperplanes, which encompass only a couple of variables at a time.\n\nThe same extension is taken a step further in the \"split criterion isolation forest\" or SCIFOREST from [15], proposing not only doing the splits by random hyperplanes, but also determining the split threshold by a deterministic criterion that aims at making each tree branch (groups that are obtained after dividing points according to the threshold) more homogeneous, and reporting increased performance metrics in typical anomaly detection datasets from these changes.\n\nThe \"robust random cut forest\" or RRCF from [11] proposed choosing the variable to split with a probability proportional to the range that it spans instead of choosing it uniformly at random, following the idea that variables with a wider ranger are more important in a multivariate distribution and more likely to differentiate outliers.\n\nOther models such as the \"density estimation trees\" or DET from [17] also propose more elaborate criteria for choosing the variable and the split point, in the case of [17] considering the distribution of all variables rather than just a subset of them as in [15], and choosing both the variable to split and the split point within the variable according to a deterministic criterion that aims at grouping together more points where the multivariate density of the data is higher, with density viewed as the amount of points per volume unit in the space spanned by the features. The \"generalized isolation forest\" (GIF) from [5] and the \"one-class random forest\" (OCRF) from [9] also proposed similar ideas, but with slightly different splitting criteria.\n\n## 3 Different types of outliers\n\nSo far, outliers or anomalies have only been characterized here as being \"few and different\" - for example, in typical datasets for outlier detection, outliers are sampled from a minority group which differs in some fundamental aspect from the majority, such as cross-sectional measurements of soil samples in which outliers are measurements taken from a different type of soil than the rest. This nevertheless does not provide the full picture, as \"outliers\u201d or \"anomalies\u201d in a dataset can be generated by different events or processes, such as incorrect data entry or attempted fraudulent purchases.\n\nA lot of literature has been written about \"extreme value\" identification in univariate distributions, which is one type of anomaly in which the value for some particular variable in an observation is very different from the rest, and can be caused e.g. by incorrect data entry that types an additional digit. More interesting classes of anomalies however typically involve relationships between many variables, with outliers not necessarily having extreme values in any particular variable, but presenting relationships between them which do not match with the rest. Most of the \"anomaly detection\" or \"one-class classification\" literature as well as public datasets focus on these cases.\n\nA distinction is made in [15] between \"scattered\" and \"clustered\" outliers, with the \"clustered\" outliers being considered as more \"interesting\", as they are classes of outliers which typically originate through some repeated process (such as fraudulent activity) as opposed to \"scattered\" outliers which originate from unrelated events. These \"clustered\u201d outliers are deemed harder to identify due to aspects such as \"masking\", which [15] tries to address in its proposed method.\n\nMost of the literature nevertheless makes no distinctions between classes of outliers. Oftentimes, a new method is introduced, and its utility demonstrated by identifying a pattern of anomality in randomly-generated data and aggregating performance metrics across different datasets, evaluating the method as a general anomaly detector. Such a presentation however provides an incomplete depiction, as different methods make a trade-off in being better at identifying certain classes of outliers at the expense of being worse at identifying others as will be shown in the following sections, but such trade-off is rarely discussed.\n\nFor example, methods based on density or likelihood such as DET will determine outlierness according to how uncommon a combination of values would be, which in a multi-modal distribution would give a more anomalous value to observations that cluster near one of the non-majority modes compared to those that cluster near the largest mode, while methods based on local outlierness or neighborhoods such as iNNE from [2] would not deem observations near minority modes any less anomalous than those near majority modes. For outliers such as those in the \"Satellite\" dataset\u00b9 for example, the latter might\n\n\u00b9http://odds.cs.stonybrook.edu/satellite-dataset/\n\nbe a disadvantage, while for outliers in the \"ForestCover\" dataset\u00b2 such a property would be desirable.\n\nThis work shows that there is no \"silver bullet\" and suggests that different methods should be employed for different outlier types or desired anomalous patterns to catch.\n\nWhile many previous works have tried to make a distinction between \"global\" and \"local\" outliers, there are other perhaps more important aspects which could be used to categorize them.

For a better-quality partition, [15] suggests trying many different linear combinations (suggestion is 10) at each step, and standardizing these numbers to make them comparable, proposing a \"gain\" criterion in a similar spirit as in supervised decision tree algorithms:\n\ngain_avg = (\u03c3_all - (\u03c3_left + \u03c3_right)/2) / \u03c3_all\n\nWhere \u03c3_left and \u03c3_right are the standard deviations observed in the distribution of the randomly-generated linear combination among the points that go to each side of the comparison threshold (\"less than\" and \"greater than\") set upon this same linear combination, and \u03c3_all is the standard deviation among these points before partitioning them.\n\nThis split criterion will tend to favor partitions in which only one or a few points are put into a single branch while the majority go to the other, leading to quick isolation of extreme-valued points but perhaps generating insufficient discrimination among non-extreme values. As many points quickly start becoming isolated in earlier splits, it takes relatively fewer splits to reach the same termination criterion used by \"iForest\", resulting in smaller trees (containing fewer nodes) and thus in principle a computationally-efficient procedure if the termination criteria remains the same. It should be noted however that the expected isolation depth for uniformly-random data in this case would not be the same as for the simpler IFOREST, but would rather be a usually larger number, given by:\n\nE[d(m)] = (\u03a3_{i=1}^{m} i) - 1 / m\n\nWhere m is the number of uniformly-random points. This comes from the fact that the optimal split for uniformly-random data corresponds to leaving a single observation in one branch and the rest in the other.\n\n***\n**Figure 1: Expected isolation depth for 4 uniform points under averaged gain**\n\n*Description: A diagram shows a simple binary tree.

RRCF is different in the sense that it relies on averaging out errors, introducing less-granular guidance to the split choices.\n\nIn theory, RRCF suffers from many of the same issues as IFOREST as outlined in e.g. [12] and [2], and visualizing its calculated anomaly scores on randomly-generated points that exemplify an extreme pattern (such as inner and outer rings, sine waves, etc.) would not look too differently from the scores produced by IFOREST - for example, in the bimodal random numbers from earlier plots, it would not identify the top-left or bottom-right outliers as the most anomalous observations, although it would rank them as relatively more anomalous compared to the rest than IFOREST would. In practice however, RRCF has demonstrated improved performance metrics when applied on real datasets of varying characteristics.\n\n## 5 Better data separations\n\nIdeally, one would want the splits made by an isolation tree to assign more points to regions where the multivariate density or likelihood of the data distribution is higher and to make these regions as narrow as needed, or under an alternative view to group together observations which are more similar, making the points in a node closer and closer further down each tree, which in broad terms requires making splits on good boundaries across the right variables.

These same designs might not be the most optimal for FCF when used for anomaly detection however, and are rather different from what DET and OCRF used. In the case of FCF, it should be taken into consideration that:\n\n*   If making splits by an averaged gain criterion, typically most of the cases will assign a single observation to one of the branches, and it could take many trials or evaluations across columns or linear combinations to choose a split that puts more than one observation in the smaller branch, which is not the case for the pooled gain criterion. What's more, if the split is performed on a linear combination of variables, it is typically enough for at least one of them to not be irrelevant in order for the linear combination to produce helpful splits.\n*   In IFOREST it was concluded that 100 trees was enough to get convergent results, but the splits generated by a pooled gain criterion on a sub-sample of the data have more expected variability, thus perhaps more trees would be needed to reach convergent results, especially in larger datasets.\n*   Both IFOREST and SCIFOREST used sub-sampling with 256 observations per tree, which in the case of IFOREST is helpful for dealing with some of the inherent problems in the method, but FCF might not suffer from the exact same problems.\n*   Both IFOREST and SCIFOREST chose a maximum depth equal to that of balanced-tree height as terminating criterion, but in the case of standardized pooled gain, it is also possible - and perhaps a more reasonable choice - to set this termination criterion on the gain itself, with nodes in which the best possible gain is less than some pre-determined acceptance level (e.g. 25%) potentially being set as terminal nodes and a remainder depth extrapolated.\n\nA small experiment with the \"SpamBase\" dataset would suggest that deeper trees are beneficial, regardless of the split criterion that is used:\n\n| Table 2: Results on \"SpamBase\" dataset with different termination criteria | | | |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Model** | **Termination** | **AUROC** | **Nodes** |\n| IFOREST | depth \u2265 8 | 0.6405 | 22,346 |\n| IFOREST | depth \u2265 16 | 0.6545 | 60,514 |\n| IFOREST | isolation | 0.6926 | 184,032 |\n| FCF | depth \u2265 8 | 0.5897 | 44,100 |\n| FCF | depth \u2265 16 | 0.6112 | 114,606 |\n| FCF | gain < 0.5 | 0.6197 | 132,694 |\n| FCF | isolation | 0.6220 | 174,960 |\n\nIncreasing the depth however also increases the standard error for the expected isolation depth that each observation would have:\n\n***\n**Figure 9: Average standard error for expected isolation depth of each observation**\n\n*Description: A 2x2 grid of line plots titled \"Standard error for average isolation depth (SpamBase Dataset)\".

with here, which consitute a mixture of different oulier types. Taking IF as a base, the only variation that sees consistently better or not-much-worse results across all types of datasets and outliers is EIF, at least when examined under the default hyperparameters of each model, which one might prefer to use in the absence of labels.

In particular, the FCF model with hyperparameters chosen more appropriately for anomaly detection (as compared to its original application field) looks to be the best performer in these cases, followed closely by RRCF-D (which uses isolation depth for calculating anomaly scores instead of the \"co-displacement\u201d metric initially proposed for this model), but with a rather large advantage over RRCF in terms of computational efficiency (should be noted again that the RRCF implementation used here was not as optimized, but the procedure itself requires checking values across all columns of the data at each node, which makes it less scalable than other split guiding heuristics). For other types of outliers such as those of minority-in-binary-classes however (e.g. \"Mnist\", \"ForestCover\"), FCF sees degraded performance compared to IF, and other families of less-local methods present better performance than either of them.\n\nSCIFOREST was found in [15] to provide an increase in AUROC under the majority of the datasets experimented with. The experiments here however show a very different picture once datasets with more varied characteristics are evaluated - for example, in the \"SpamBase\" dataset, SCIFOREST results in a very large performance drop compared to IF, even driving the AUROC below 0.5 (which is what random predictions would achieve). It should also be noted that these experiments failed to reproduce similar AUROC numbers under the same datasets used in [15], but once the depth limit was removed from the algorithm, the AUROC metrics became very similar to those reported there.\n\nIn [10], they report AUROC and AUPR metrics for many of the same datasets and baselines as in here, following a very similar methodology, but the results obtained in this experiment differ very significantly from those reported in [10], both for the proposed OCRF algorithm as well as for the baselines compared against - for example, [10] reports an AUROC of 0.850 in the SpamBase dataset for OCRF, while the experiments here reached an average AUROC of 0.4335 only, and while [10] found OCRF to outperform IF in 10 out of 12 datasets, that was the case only in 2 out of the 9 datasets experimented with in here (down to 1 dataset if considering IF-U). What's more, the proposed OCRF algorithm in some cases ended up producing the exact same outlier score for all observations, which made calculation of metrics not meaningful.\n\nComputation times in this experiment also showed how different implementations of the same algorithm can result in widly different execution speed, suggesting that the running times reported by previous works might not provide fair comparisons of the relative efficiency of algorithms.
