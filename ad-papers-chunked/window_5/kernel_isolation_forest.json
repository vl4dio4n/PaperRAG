INTRODUCTION\n\nHYPERSPECTRAL remotely sensed images contain hundreds or even thousands of spectral bands, which provides a powerful tool for many remote sensing applications, such as anomaly detection [1], [2], image visualization [3], [4], and classification of the land covers [5], [6].  Among these applications, hyperspectral anomaly detection has received considerable interest in recent years due to its importance in military defense, search-and-rescue, mine detection, and environmental monitoring.  Hyperspectral anomaly detection aims at distinguishing the interesting targets that are very different spatially or spectrally from their surrounding background with no a prior knowledge about the spectral signatures of background and target.  In essence, anomaly detection is usually regarded as a binary classification problem, which classifies the pixel under test as the anomaly class or the background class.\n\n Manuscript received March 12, 2019; revised June 19, 2019 and July 11, 2019; accepted August 9, 2019.

Specifically, the major contributions of this article can be concluded as follows.\n\n 1) A recursive anomaly detection framework is developed which can well make use of the global and local information of HSIs.\n 2) A KIFD is proposed for the first time which can well capture the isolation property of anomaly objects in HSIs.  Experiments performed on several real hyperspectral data sets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method.\n\n The rest of this article is organized as follows.

Parameter Analysis\n\nIn this section, we analyze the influence of the parameter \u03b6 on the detection performance of the proposed KIFD method.  The parameter \u03b6 controls the number of principal components.  Fig.  8 shows the effect of the parameter \u03b6 over the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) values of the KIFD on each data set.  We can observe that AUC values tend to grow gradually when \u03b6 varies from 50 to 300 for all the data sets, except for the HYDICE data set.  For the HYDICE data set, it can be seen that when \u03b6 increases from 50 up to 150, AUC values tend to grow gradually.  When \u03b6 is greater than 150, the AUC values tend to be stable and may decrease slightly.  In a nutshell, when \u03b6 = 300, the proposed KIFD can obtain a satisfactory detection performance.

Specifically, given a detection map and a ground truth map, the PD and FAR can be calculated as follows:\nPD = N_D / N_T, FAR = N_F / N (5)\nwhere N_D is the number of detected target pixels under a certain threshold for the detection map and N_T is the total number of real target pixels in the image, N_F is the number of false alarm pixels and N is the number of pixels in the HSI.  By comparing with the ROC curves of different methods, if a method has a higher PD than the other methods at the same false alarm, it demonstrates that the method outperforms the other methods.  The second metric is the AUC, which is derived from the ROC curve and calculated with the whole area under ROC curve.  A larger AUC value means the detector obtains a better detection performance.
