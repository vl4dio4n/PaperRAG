The method is based on an assumption that anomalies rather than background can be more susceptible to isolation in the kernel space. Based on this idea, the proposed method detects anomalies as follows. First, the hyperspectral data are mapped into the kernel space, and the first K principal components are used. Then, the isolation samples in the image are detected with the iForest constructed using randomly selected samples in the principal components. Finally, the initial anomaly detection map is iteratively refined with locally constructed iForest in connected regions with large areas.

INTRODUCTION\n\nHYPERSPECTRAL remotely sensed images contain hundreds or even thousands of spectral bands, which provides a powerful tool for many remote sensing applications, such as anomaly detection [1], [2], image visualization [3], [4], and classification of the land covers [5], [6]. Among these applications, hyperspectral anomaly detection has received considerable interest in recent years due to its importance in military defense, search-and-rescue, mine detection, and environmental monitoring. Hyperspectral anomaly detection aims at distinguishing the interesting targets that are very different spatially or spectrally from their surrounding background with no a prior knowledge about the spectral signatures of background and target. In essence, anomaly detection is usually regarded as a binary classification problem, which classifies the pixel under test as the anomaly class or the background class.\n\nManuscript received March 12, 2019; revised June 19, 2019 and July 11, 2019; accepted August 9, 2019.

Statistical model-based probability distribution is the first and the most prevalent category in hyperspectral anomaly detection [7]\u2013[10]. One of the most well-known methods is Reed\u2013Xiaoli (RX) algorithm [11], developed by Reed and Xiaoli, which is considered the benchmark method. The RX detector assumes that the background is well modeled with a Gaussian multivariate distribution. Based on the assumption, the background can be characterized with the mean vector and the covariance matrix of the pixels in the whole image or a local window surrounding the test pixel. Then, the anomaly pixels are detected by measuring the Mahalanobis distance between the test pixel and the local background. It is worth mentioning that the pixels modeled the background can include the whole image or local background, thus leading to global detector [12] or local detector [13], respectively. However, most real-world HSIs cannot be modeled by a homogeneous distribution, which often cover different classes of materials and exhibit complex background. To address this problem, a variety of improved RX-based anomaly detectors have been proposed. For example, the sub-space RX anomaly detector [14] models the background with representative eigenvectors of the HSI covariance matrix, which eliminates the undesired background signatures in HSI. The kernel-RX anomaly detector is a nonlinear version of the RX detector developed by Kwon and Nasrabadi [15], which characterizes more adequately the normal model in a higher dimensional feature space by using the kernel method. The cluster-based anomaly detector (CBAD) [16] first performs clustering methods on the HSI, thus yielding several Gaussian clusters that are spectrally homogeneous. Then, the anomalies are detected in each cluster.\n\nBesides the probability distribution-based methods, there are many other types of anomaly detection methods in the literature. For example, the support vector data description (SVDD)-based anomaly method [17] is a deterministic support vector approach that avoids prior assumptions about the data distribution. The SVDD is capable of estimating the support region where most of the data lie, which avoids the much more enormous challenge of estimating the underlying probability density function. The method is based on the assumption that a pixel in background can be approximately represented by a linear combination of its surrounding pixels, while the anomaly cannot. The contribution of each surrounding pixel is adjusted by a distance-weighted regularization matrix. Recently, a novel attribute and edge-preserving filtering-based detection method (AED) [18] has been proposed. Different from previous works, the method only requires local filtering operations (i.e., attribute and edge preserving), and thus, it can be implemented very efficiently. Moreover, a multi-scale version of the AED has been developed in [19], which considered the multi-scale information in HSIs.\n\nAdditionally, sparse representation has received considerable attention for hyperspectral anomaly detection. In [20], the anomaly detector is modeled by the use of background joint sparse representation (BJSR). The most representative background bases are adaptively selected for the local region, and then, the background pixels can be well represented with the selected background bases while the anomaly cannot. Based on a similar idea, sparse representation, collaborative representation, and tensor representation-based anomaly detection methods have been well investigated in recent years [21]\u2013[26]. Recently, deep learning has been a very active research topic in the field of HSI processing [27], [28], and deep learning-based anomaly detector [29] also has been proposed.\n\nDifferent from the aforementioned methods, a novel Kernel Isolation Forest-based hyperspectral anomaly Detection method (KIFD) is proposed in this article. From a data description aspect, the anomalies usually have different spectral values with respect to the background, and thus, these pixels are usually more susceptible to isolation than the background. By constructing Isolation Forest (iForest) using randomly selected samples of the HSI, those pixels that can be isolated easily in the kernel feature space are detected as anomalies. Furthermore, in this article, the detection is performed with a novel recursive detection framework, which can well make full use of the local and global information of HSIs. It should be mentioned that an earlier version of this article has been submitted to the 2019 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium. Specifically, the major contributions of this article can be concluded as follows.\n\n1) A recursive anomaly detection framework is developed which can well make use of the global and local information of HSIs.\n2) A KIFD is proposed for the first time which can well capture the isolation property of anomaly objects in HSIs. Experiments performed on several real hyperspectral data sets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method.\n\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2184, "end_char_idx": 8491, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, {"id_": "e827c00c-be9b-4c2b-9a46-cdd201016fde", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest", "authors": "Li et al.", "year": 2019, "file_path": "ad-papers-pdf/kernel_isolation_forest.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "46204ec6-88ff-414b-a276-fd6e0a91991d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"title": "Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest", "authors": "Li et al.", "year": 2019, "file_path": "ad-papers-pdf/kernel_isolation_forest.pdf"}, "hash": "58fb428496c698b28817546e605cd4634f36b036153fc2dde7d77d64f103db91", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0a405b29-24d0-4b0c-979c-de46aecba4ce", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"title": "Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest", "authors": "Li et al.", "year": 2019, "file_path": "ad-papers-pdf/kernel_isolation_forest.pdf"}, "hash": "149d702c7343f7c84f078c7fc436d11dbbabaf0a357cade694d2a0f342dc9ff7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0ea56a87-17f1-4561-88b1-0246ae8b8910", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c6c1e963d230b741c7476cece181c53695e02be1b20df9b2cadf8c833c71468b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The rest of this article is organized as follows.

BACKGROUND\n\n### A. Isolation Forest\n\niForest is firstly introduced by Liu et al. [30] for outlier detection in data mining. The advantage of iForest is that it can identity outliers directly based on the concept of isolation without using any metrics, this eliminates computational cost significantly compared to the distance-based [31] and density-based methods [32]. Here, the principle of iForest is briefly reviewed. The details of the iForest algorithm, we refer the reader to [30].\n\nSpecifically, iForest is based on the assumption that the anomaly instances are usually rare and different from those of normal instances in a given data set, which makes them more susceptible to isolation in a number of binary tree structures than the normal instances. A tree structure is constructed from the root to leaves by dividing the data at each node with a random selected feature and threshold. Each tree is grown until each instance is isolated in a leaf. The path length for an instance, also known as the isolation depth, is defined as that the instance traverses a binary tree from the root node until the traversal is terminated at a leaf node. Therefore, in randomly generated binary tree where instances are recursively partitioned, anomalous instances have a quick arrival to leaf nodes, while nominal instances require many more splits to finally reach leaf nodes. As a whole, anomalous instances have noticeable shorter average path lengths than those of normal instances over a number of binary trees. The anomaly score assigned to an instance can be calculated using the average isolation depth across the binary trees.\n\nTo demonstrate the fact that anomalies have higher susceptibility to be isolated under random partitioning, a graphical interpretation for a 2-D normally distributed data set is represented as in Fig. 1. It can be seen that the inlier xh (i.e., normal instance) generally requires more separating lines to be isolated, while the outlier xa (i.e., anomalous instance) generally requires less separating lines to be isolated. In this example, every partitioning process is generated by randomly selecting an attribute and randomly selecting a cut-point between the minimum and maximum values of the selected attribute. Since a binary tree is generated by recursive partitioning, the path length from the root node to a leaf node can represent the number of partitions required to isolate a point. Thus, the path length of xa is shorter than the path length of xb.\n\niForest was proposed almost ten years ago. In recent years, the algorithm has been successfully applied in real applications, such as detecting anomalous taxi trajectories or detecting the anomalous data collected from wireless sensor networks [33]\u2013[35]. To our best knowledge, the method has not been researched in remote sensing applications. In this article, we develop an iForest method to detect anomalies in HSIs.\n\n***\n**Fig. ", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 8755, "end_char_idx": 11691, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, {"id_": "190ea43c-0429-413a-b6a5-f308fb65df24", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest", "authors": "Li et al.", "year": 2019, "file_path": "ad-papers-pdf/kernel_isolation_forest.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "46204ec6-88ff-414b-a276-fd6e0a91991d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"title": "Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest", "authors": "Li et al.", "year": 2019, "file_path": "ad-papers-pdf/kernel_isolation_forest.pdf"}, "hash": "58fb428496c698b28817546e605cd4634f36b036153fc2dde7d77d64f103db91", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0ea56a87-17f1-4561-88b1-0246ae8b8910", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"title": "Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest", "authors": "Li et al.", "year": 2019, "file_path": "ad-papers-pdf/kernel_isolation_forest.pdf"}, "hash": "a2555aa338003e0927a9cc151619f9e652826a3ff36b9a8c21dc4b874e434d7b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dd9843b5-ac40-4a1a-ae85-a455da314159", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5a06dbf3cdbeab15154afa72d7d9b61bf222c626437dd45952d510f4b3225f87", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "1.** Graph example illustrating the principle of iForest.

PROPOSED APPROACH\n\n### A. Constructing Isolation Forest\n\nHere, X \u2208 \u211d^(D\u00d7N) denotes the input HSI, where D represents the number of spectral bands and N is the number of pixels. In order to construct the iForest globally, M pixels are first randomly selected from the hyperspectral data. Then, the selected pixels can be divided into two child nodes, i.e., left node M\u2081 and right node M\u1d63, based on a simple decision rule. Specifically, if X^m_s is smaller than \u03b8, the mth selected pixel will be divided into the left node, and vice versa. Here, s is a number randomly selected from 1 to D, \u03b8 is a value randomly selected between the minimum value and maximum value of the sth band, i.e., X^s. Next, the child nodes could be further divided by performing the operations above iteratively, until either: 1) the tree reaches a height limit Hmax; 2) the number of pixels in each child node equals 1; and 3) the pixels in each child node have the same values. It should be mentioned that s and \u03b8 are both randomly selected for all the internal nodes. In this article, Hmax = log\u2082 M is set as the default parameter setting. The tree construction process can be repeated q times so as to construct the iForest, and q is set as 1000, which means that the forest consists of 1000 trees.\n\n***\n**Fig. ", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 14361, "end_char_idx": 15658, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, {"id_": "dcaa0560-2979-49fa-ba9b-6bad8c64f123", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest", "authors": "Li et al.", "year": 2019, "file_path": "ad-papers-pdf/kernel_isolation_forest.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "46204ec6-88ff-414b-a276-fd6e0a91991d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"title": "Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest", "authors": "Li et al.", "year": 2019, "file_path": "ad-papers-pdf/kernel_isolation_forest.pdf"}, "hash": "58fb428496c698b28817546e605cd4634f36b036153fc2dde7d77d64f103db91", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "41a0d8ef-afab-40f4-a932-2b02978d7ff6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"title": "Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest", "authors": "Li et al.", "year": 2019, "file_path": "ad-papers-pdf/kernel_isolation_forest.pdf"}, "hash": "c2260ad708647e5a2ef717098ad1c2b3223f94817336abb74ad33ac63265f122", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cac54bea-79d8-468c-b24d-f70149b90bce", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d7338444905d934507e14dc20e75888ed2ba529fd3aafe0391f434c77ace069f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "2.** Graph example illustrating the structure of an Isolation Tree.\n\n*   **Image Description:** A diagram of an Isolation Tree.

Detecting the Anomalies Using Isolation Forest\n\nIn this step, each pixel in the HSI is fed into the constructed iForest so as to detect the anomalies. Specifically, in an isolation tree, the path length of a pixel is defined as the number of edges that the pixel travels from the root to an external node. Since anomaly pixels usually appear with small area and distinct spectral signatures which are different from background, they are easily isolated to external nodes, and have shorter path lengths. By contrast, background pixels will tend to have longer path lengths in the constructed isolation trees. Based on this fact, path length can be employed as a measure to detect anomalies. It should be noted that a pixel may have different path lengths on different isolation trees. Therefore, the proposed isolation-based anomaly detection method is based on an ensemble learning mechanism, in which the final path length for each pixel is obtained by averaging path lengths of different isolation trees.\n\nAn iForest consists of q isolation trees {Q\u2081, Q\u2082, . .

For better understanding, the flowchart of the proposed KIFD method is shown in Fig. 3. As shown in this figure, the proposed method consists of the following major steps. First, the dimension of the input image is reduced with KPCA. Then, the iForest is constructed so as to obtain an initial anomaly detection map. Finally, the final anomaly detection map is obtained by refining the initial anomaly detection map with the local iForest.\n\n## IV. EXPERIMENTS\n\n### A.

Parameter Analysis\n\nIn this section, we analyze the influence of the parameter \u03b6 on the detection performance of the proposed KIFD method. The parameter \u03b6 controls the number of principal components. Fig. 8 shows the effect of the parameter \u03b6 over the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) values of the KIFD on each data set. We can observe that AUC values tend to grow gradually when \u03b6 varies from 50 to 300 for all the data sets, except for the HYDICE data set. For the HYDICE data set, it can be seen that when \u03b6 increases from 50 up to 150, AUC values tend to grow gradually. When \u03b6 is greater than 150, the AUC values tend to be stable and may decrease slightly. In a nutshell, when \u03b6 = 300, the proposed KIFD can obtain a satisfactory detection performance. Therefore, in this article, the default parameter of the KIFD is set as \u03b6 = 300.\n\n\u00b9http://www.escience.cn/people/xudongkang\n\n***\n**Fig. ", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 24904, "end_char_idx": 26555, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, {"id_": "6cbfc5e7-4652-4da8-a313-f6cbcff06532", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest", "authors": "Li et al.", "year": 2019, "file_path": "ad-papers-pdf/kernel_isolation_forest.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "46204ec6-88ff-414b-a276-fd6e0a91991d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"title": "Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest", "authors": "Li et al.", "year": 2019, "file_path": "ad-papers-pdf/kernel_isolation_forest.pdf"}, "hash": "58fb428496c698b28817546e605cd4634f36b036153fc2dde7d77d64f103db91", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "70b34185-f812-4ee8-8326-6a5b47b3a5f0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"title": "Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest", "authors": "Li et al.", "year": 2019, "file_path": "ad-papers-pdf/kernel_isolation_forest.pdf"}, "hash": "768710522f62ea49abe9280e4957c0a2f463c1665733010df6e9a86865bbcccd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "122e9af9-e114-4a22-9293-f31ad80f4aa2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1736ebd7ad303da16e8e9297d24a12fcbeb568bd0e71a6084d4591b003811b34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "6.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 26555, "end_char_idx": 26557, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, {"id_": "122e9af9-e114-4a22-9293-f31ad80f4aa2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest", "authors": "Li et al.", "year": 2019, "file_path": "ad-papers-pdf/kernel_isolation_forest.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "46204ec6-88ff-414b-a276-fd6e0a91991d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"title": "Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest", "authors": "Li et al.", "year": 2019, "file_path": "ad-papers-pdf/kernel_isolation_forest.pdf"}, "hash": "58fb428496c698b28817546e605cd4634f36b036153fc2dde7d77d64f103db91", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6cbfc5e7-4652-4da8-a313-f6cbcff06532", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"title": "Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest", "authors": "Li et al.", "year": 2019, "file_path": "ad-papers-pdf/kernel_isolation_forest.pdf"}, "hash": "b382c2ed1618b0f6d9d6102807aea2a8d10af9722298468bc2f93050c7988ce1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2924c2d2-ee12-4788-a71f-290c996550e3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c26395d2e564c7f9bf851d2cc3688f59b98a5191833079e3286ee8279d90046c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "** El Segundo data set.

Analysis the Influence of the Global and Local Isolation Forest-Based Detection Steps\n\nIn this section, we analyze the influence of the global and local iForest-based detection steps on the performance of the proposed method.

Detection Performance\n\nIn this section, the anomaly detection performance of the proposed IFD and KIFD are evaluated and compared with four state-of-the-art detectors: the RX detector [11], local RX detector (LRX) [11], the AED [18], and Collaborative Representation-based Detector (CRD) [22]. The RX and LRX detectors are most widely used as the benchmark methods for comparing the performance of a new anomaly detector. The CRD and AED were recently developed AD methods, which have leading performances on several real hyperspectral data sets.\n\nIn the experiments, three of the most widely used metrics for anomaly detection evaluation are exploited to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the detection performances of those compared methods. The first metric is the ROC curve, which describes the relationship between the probability of detection (PD) and the false alarm rate (FAR) at various threshold settings based on the ground truth. Specifically, given a detection map and a ground truth map, the PD and FAR can be calculated as follows:\nPD = N_D / N_T, FAR = N_F / N (5)\nwhere N_D is the number of detected target pixels under a certain threshold for the detection map and N_T is the total number of real target pixels in the image, N_F is the number of false alarm pixels and N is the number of pixels in the HSI. By comparing with the ROC curves of different methods, if a method has a higher PD than the other methods at the same false alarm, it demonstrates that the method outperforms the other methods. The second metric is the AUC, which is derived from the ROC curve and calculated with the whole area under ROC curve. A larger AUC value means the detector obtains a better detection performance. More detailed illustration of these two evaluation indexes can be found in [42]. The third metric is the separability range, which describes the ability of detector to separate anomalies from the background [43]. A better detector would obtain a more efficient separation of the anomalies and background.\n\nIn order to evaluate the detection performances of compared methods, we perform experiments on the above-mentioned four data sets and generate the results reported in Figs. 4\u20137. In the experiments, the optimal parameters of the LRX, AED, and CRD methods are selected for each data set according to the corresponding AUC performances. For example, the detection performance of AED method is sensitive to the area parameter \u03ba. Then, based on the AUC metric, the optimal parameter \u03ba ranging from 5 to 300 is selected optimally. In addition, it is known that the detection performances of the LRX and CRD methods are sensitive to the window sizes (\u03c9_in and \u03c9_out). Similarly, the optimal window sizes \u03c9_in ranging from 3 to 41 and \u03c9_out ranging from 5 to 71 are selected optimally. The detailed optimal parameters of those compared methods are presented in Table I. For the proposed IFD and KIFD methods, the default parameters are set as M = 3% \u00d7 N (N is the number of pixels in the HSI, q = 1000. Furthermore, for the KIFD method, the number of principal components \u03b6 is set as 300.\n\nFirst, the detection maps of the compared anomaly detection methods on the four real hyperspectral data sets are shown in Figs. 4\u20137. It can be seen that the proposed IFD method shows competitive performances with respect to the RX method, and the KIFD method can detect anomalies more accurately and clearly than the IFD method and other compared methods. For example, in Fig. 4, the KIFD method can accurately detect all airplanes and obtain a good extraction of the airplanes. The IFD and RX methods both have ability to detect all airplanes, but the shapes of some airplanes are missing. The LRX method can penalize background effectively, but cannot detect all anomalies. The AED and CRD methods also recognize the locations of airplanes, while the shapes of the airplanes are blurring and some false anomalies are also detected. It should be mentioned that some buildings that are quite different spectrally from their surrounding are considered as anomalies for all the compared methods. The reason is that some background pixels that have spectral difference with respect to their neighboring pixels would be also detected as anomalies. Moreover, the proposed KIFD and IFD methods show robust detection performance in large size scenes. As shown in Fig. 6, most of the anomaly pixels can be detected by the KIFD method. The reason is that, with the kernel method, the KIFD can achieve better background suppression and derive a detection result with less false alarms.\n\n**TABLE I**\n**OPTIMAL PARAMETERS OF THE LRX, AED, AND CRD METHODS FOR THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA SETS**\n\n| | LRX [11] | AED [18] | CRD [22] |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| | \u03c9_in / \u03c9_out | \u03ba | \u03c9_in / \u03c9_out |\n| San Diego | 37x37 / 55x55 | 25 | 3x3 / 31x31 |\n| | \u03c9_in / \u03c9_out | \u03ba | \u03c9_in / \u03c9_out |\n| HYDICE | 3x3 / 5x5 | 5 | 7x7 / 15x15 |\n| | \u03c9_in / \u03c9_out | \u03ba | \u03c9_in / \u03c9_out |\n| Segundo | 9x9 / 31x31 | 250 | 15x15 / 31x31 |\n| | \u03c9_in / \u03c9_out | \u03ba | \u03c9_in / \u03c9_out |\n| Grand Isle | 9x9 / 11x11 | 250 | 9x9 / 11x11 |\n\n***\n**Fig. 10.** ROC curves of the algorithms for (a) San Diego data set, (b) HYDICE data set, (c) Segundo data set, and (d) Grand Isle data set.\n\n*   **Image Description:** Four ROC curve plots, one for each dataset.

First, the RX usually has stable detection performances, but fail to detect all the anomalies due to the contamination of background statistical estimation. Second, since the detection performances of the LRX and CRD methods are sensitive to the window sizes, when the sizes and shapes of anomaly targets are relatively different and irregular, some of the anomalies cannot be detected [see Fig. 6(f) and (h)]. Third, due to the blurring effect produced in the filtering operation, those small-scale anomaly targets may be failed to be detected [see Figs. 5(g) and 6(g)].\n\nSecond, we also calculate the AUC scores of the compared algorithms as shown in Table II, in which the best AUC score is highlighted for each experimental data set. According to Table II, we can find that the KIFD achieves the best scores on all experimental data sets. The IFD also obtains satisfactory AUC scores, except for the HYDICE data set. The RX and CRD achieve the lowest detection accuracy for the San Diego data set and EI Segundo data set, respectively. Although the LRX and AED methods have relatively stable detection performances, it does not in any case obtain the highest AUC scores. In addition, Fig. 10 presents a quantitative comparison of different methods with the ROC curves. Note that for the ROC curve, a better detector would lie nearer the upper left corner (0, 1) and result in achieving higher detection accuracy at the same false alarm. As shown in Fig. 10 (Log\u2081\u2080 coordinate is used), the KIFD method is superior to the IFD, RX, LRX, AED and CRD methods under most conditions. It can be seen from Fig. 10(a) and (d) that the proposed KIFD method obtains much better ROC curves than the other compared methods since its probabilities of detection are always higher than others when FAR varies from 0.001 to 1. As shown in Fig. 10(b), it can be observed that the proposed KIFD method obtains higher probabilities of detection than the other compared methods under most conditions. As shown in Fig. 10(c), compared with the AED method, the proposed KIFD method obtains slightly lower probabilities of detection when the FAR varies from 0.001 to 0.005. However, the general performance of the proposed KIFD method is still better than the other algorithms.\n\nThird, box plots are exploited to further evaluate the detection performance of proposed KIFD method via separability maps, as shown in Fig. 11.

As shown in this table, it is important to notice that the KIFD is computationally more expensive than the IFD as expected, while is much more efficient than the LRX and CRD methods.\n\n**TABLE III**\n**RUNNING TIME (SECONDS) OF THE ALGORITHMS FOR THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA SETS**\n\n| Time (s) | KIFD | IFD | RX [11] | LRX [11] | AED [18] | CRD [22] |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| San Diego | 85.44 | 42.86 | 0.19 | 136.48 | 0.29 | 2128.32 |\n| HYDICE | 58.57 | 28.92 | 0.09 | 18.40 | 0.21 | 64.00 |\n| Segundo | 206.94 | 151.69 | 0.96 | 1229.67 | 1.73 | 9567.85 |\n| Grand Isle | 378.09 | 300.16 | 1.92 | 1042.89 | 3.35 | 1665.18 |\n\n***\n**Fig. 12.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 39384, "end_char_idx": 41352, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, {"id_": "68859773-378b-4f8b-b8f0-e2960cffece8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest", "authors": "Li et al.", "year": 2019, "file_path": "ad-papers-pdf/kernel_isolation_forest.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "46204ec6-88ff-414b-a276-fd6e0a91991d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"title": "Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest", "authors": "Li et al.", "year": 2019, "file_path": "ad-papers-pdf/kernel_isolation_forest.pdf"}, "hash": "58fb428496c698b28817546e605cd4634f36b036153fc2dde7d77d64f103db91", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bb896516-b590-42de-be9b-a62a504e9c71", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"title": "Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest", "authors": "Li et al.", "year": 2019, "file_path": "ad-papers-pdf/kernel_isolation_forest.pdf"}, "hash": "cff919c17a1d0e06c1abcc01effdaf2ec9379bd5c7bc206b64c12856c3471c1d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d143286a-a6e6-4f5d-adb9-947095484d1e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e2e91604cbabee7cc4ff0b69e2ecf3b1f6336a2dfc36fd8d905a91006f0d920d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "** (a) Influence of the parameter M on the detection performance of the proposed KIFD on each data set.

Discussion\n\nIn this section, we undertook the experiments to show how the randomness of proposed KIFD method affects to results.\n\nFig. 12 presents the influence of different subsampling sizes M to the detection performance and the computing time on each data set. As shown in Fig. 12(a), it can be seen that the AUC values increase at first, then decrease slightly, and finally reach their peaks at 3 for the San Diego and Segundo data sets. For the HYDICE and Grand Isle data sets, we can see that the proposed KIFD obtains a steady detection performance when M is less than 3. However, when M continues to increase, the AUC values of proposed KIFD start to decrease. Therefore, in this article, we select M = 3% \u00d7 N (N is the number of pixels in the HSI) as the default parameter of the proposed method. As shown in Fig. 12(b), execution time of the proposed KIFD method achieves nearly linear growth when subsampling size M increases. In this article, anomaly score of each hyperspectral pixel is evaluated by the average path length over q trees. The average path length would be more desirable when q is large enough.

Here, we can observe that the average path lengths have a trend to drop first and then rise when q varies from 1 to 1000. When q continues to increase, the average path lengths converge. Therefore, in this article, we select q = 1000 as the default parameter of the proposed method. Finally, Fig. 13(b) presents the influence of this randomness selection step on the proposed KIFD method. It can be clearly observed that the AUC values of the proposed method vary in a small range in ten repeated experiments. For example, the AUC values vary within the range between 0.9912 and 0.9923 on the San Diego data set. Therefore, it can be concluded that the random selection operation actually has a little impact on the detection performance of the proposed method.\n\n## V. CONCLUSION\n\nIn this article, we have proposed a novel iForest-based anomaly detection algorithm as well as its kernel version for HSIs. In the proposed IFD method, a global iForest is first performed on original HSI to obtain an initial anomaly scores map. Then, the initial score map is refined with a local iForest to obtain the final detection map. The advantage of the proposed framework is that it can make full use of the global and local information in a HSI. Additionally, to better separate the anomaly and background, the original hyperspectral data is projected into a kernel feature space by using kernel method. Experiments on four real hyperspectral data sets show that the KIFD can outperform the IFD and other state-of-the-art methods in terms of both objective and subjective evaluations. The iForest method is capable of detecting anomalies with high efficiency. In the future, how to implement the proposed method to detect the oil spill by optical remote sensing will be the focus.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n[1] D. W. J. Stein, S. G. Beaven, L. E. Hoff, E. M.
