Response:
Based on the provided context, the standard Isolation Forest produces several specific artifacts in its anomaly score heat maps that the Extended Isolation Forest is designed to fix:

*   **Axis-Parallel Line Patterns:** The standard algorithm generates "line patterns parallel to the coordinate axes" [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. These appear as "distinct horizontal and vertical bands" or "rectangular regions" in the anomaly score maps [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. For a single, circular cluster of data, this artifact makes the low-anomaly score region appear as a rounded square or a cross, rather than the expected circular shape [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

*   **"Ghost" Clusters and Artifacts:** The algorithm produces "ghost artifacts"—regions that are assigned a low anomaly score even though they contain little or no data [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. When multiple data clusters are present, the vertical and horizontal bands extend from each cluster's center. At the intersections of these bands, the artifact is "amplified," creating "ghost" clusters—spots with high anomaly scores that wrongly suggest a non-existent structure in the data [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

These issues arise because the standard Isolation Forest's branch cuts are always horizontal or vertical, which introduces a bias [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. The Extended Isolation Forest aims to fix this by allowing the data to be sliced using hyperplanes with random slopes, which removes the axis-parallel bands and "ghost" clusters [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the standard Isolation Forest algorithm suffers from a bias because its branching process only uses axis-parallel cuts, meaning branch cuts are always horizontal or vertical [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. This "axis-parallel" bias leads to inconsistent anomaly scores and creates artificial zones of higher or lower scores that are not present in the original data [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Two approaches were proposed to fix this issue:

1.  **Data Rotation:** This method involves rotating the sub-sample of data by a random angle before constructing each tree. While this improves performance by averaging out the total sum of biases from all trees in the ensemble, it is considered a less desirable solution. Each individual tree still suffers from the rectangular bias, and this approach requires extra bookkeeping to store the unique rotation for each tree, which can be cumbersome in higher dimensions [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

2.  **Extended Isolation Forest (EIF):** This is the preferred method that completely resolves the bias [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. EIF modifies and generalizes the branching process by allowing the branch cuts to be hyperplanes with random slopes, rather than being restricted to axis-parallel cuts [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. Instead of selecting a random feature and a random value, the EIF algorithm determines two random pieces of information at each branching node: a random normal vector ($\vec{n}$) and a random intercept point ($\vec{p}$) to define the slicing hyperplane [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

This approach has different "extension levels" for an N-dimensional dataset. The lowest level, or "0th extension," is identical to the standard Isolation Forest, where hyperplanes are parallel to all but one axis. As the extension level increases, the slicing hyperplanes are allowed to be less parallel to the coordinate axes, which reduces the algorithm's bias. The fully extended case allows the hyperplanes to have any random slope [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. By generalizing the splitting condition, EIF eliminates the artifacts and "ghost regions" seen in standard Isolation Forest score maps and produces more robust anomaly scores with smaller variance [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. EIF consistently performed better than the standard Isolation Forest on benchmark datasets [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Response:
In Functional Isolation Forest (FIF), data is projected by calculating the scalar product between an observation and an element from a chosen dictionary, which creates a feature that partially describes the observation [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

### The Projection Mechanism
The core of the method is to project observations, which are functions (e.g., `x`), onto elements of a dictionary `D` (e.g., `d`). This projection is defined by the scalar product `(x, d)_H`, which results in a real-valued feature called a *Split variable* [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019]. For multivariate functional data with `d` dimensions, the projection is extended by taking the coordinate-wise sum of the scalar products for each component: `(f, g) := ∑_{i=1}^d (f⁽ⁱ⁾, g⁽ⁱ⁾)_H` [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

Once a *Split variable* (a dictionary element `d`) is selected, a *Split value* is chosen by uniformly drawing a value from the range defined by the minimum and maximum projections of the current data onto `d` [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

### Role of the Dictionary
The choice of a dictionary `D` is a key part of the algorithm's construction. The dictionary is a set of functions chosen to be rich enough to explore different properties of the data [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019]. This allows for the incorporation of *a priori* information or expert knowledge about the data [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019]. The dictionary can be composed of deterministic functions, stochastic elements, or even the dataset itself. Examples of dictionaries used include:
*   Mexican hat wavelet (MHW)
*   Brownian motion (B)
*   Brownian bridge (BB)
*   Cosine (Cos)
*   Uniform and Dyadic indicator (UI, DI)
*   Self-data (Self) [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

### Role of the Scalar Product
The scalar product provides additional flexibility to target different kinds of anomalies. The choice of scalar product determines what type of functional properties are being compared and can be selected to change the scope of anomaly detection [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].
*   An **L₂ scalar product** allows for the detection of *location anomalies* [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].
*   An **L₂ scalar product of derivatives** allows for the detection of *shape anomalies* [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

To account for both location and shape anomalies simultaneously, a composite scalar product can be used, such as a weighted average of the L₂ scalar product and the L₂ scalar product of the derivatives [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

Response:
Based on the provided context, Generalized Isolation Forest (GIF) improves upon Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) by changing the hyperplane selection strategy to completely eliminate the creation of empty branches, which is a significant drawback of EIF [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

**The Problem with EIF:**

In EIF, the strategy of using random hyperplanes can generate many empty branches, especially as the tree depth or the number of dimensions increases [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. Empty branches occur because EIF's intercept points are sampled within the axis-bounding hypercube of the data, which can result in splits that fall outside the convex hull of the actual data points. This creates partitions with no data, increasing tree complexity and adding computational overhead [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

**How GIF Solves the Problem:**

GIF modifies the splitting mechanism to guarantee that every split partitions the data into two non-empty subsets [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. Instead of sampling within a hypercube, GIF effectively reduces the sampling volume to the convex hull of the data [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. This is achieved through the following steps:

1.  A random normal unit vector `w` is selected [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
2.  All data points (`X`) are projected onto this vector (`x^T · w`) [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
3.  The minimum (`p_min`) and maximum (`p_max`) values of these projections are found [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
4.  A split value `p` is sampled uniformly only within the interval defined by these minimum and maximum values: `p ~ U(p_min, p_max)` [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

By ensuring the split value is always between the minimum and maximum projections, this strategy guarantees that there is at least one data point in each new branch, making the probability of creating an empty branch zero [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

**The Benefits of this Improvement:**

The main advantage of GIF's approach is improved computational performance [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. By generating trees without any empty branches, GIF significantly improves execution times when compared to EIF, requiring "significantly smaller" time to compute the forests [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. While anomaly detection performance is generally similar between the two algorithms, GIF is faster "thanks to the absence of empty branches in the trees" [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

Response:
The K-Means Isolation Forest (K-Means IF) algorithm integrates K-Means clustering into its partitioning strategy to create a density-aware, multi-branch tree structure [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

The process at each node in the tree is as follows:
1.  **Random Component Selection**: The algorithm begins by randomly selecting a single attribute (component) from the dataset [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
2.  **Data Projection**: All data points at the current node are projected onto this single selected component [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
3.  **K-Means Clustering**: The K-Means clustering algorithm is then applied to the projected one-dimensional data to determine partition boundaries. The optimal number of clusters, `k`, is determined using the "elbow" rule or "elbow method" [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].
4.  **Multi-Branch Partitioning**: Instead of a purely random binary split, the node is partitioned into `k` branches, where each branch corresponds to one of the clusters identified by K-Means. The resulting clusters and their limits create the new child nodes (or leaves) for the current node [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].
5.  **Data Assignment**: Each data point is assigned to the child node corresponding to the cluster it most likely belongs to, based on the distance from the point to the cluster's centroid [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

This approach allows the tree structure to adapt to the local density of the data, creating "wider" trees with multiple branches at each level, in contrast to the strictly binary trees used in the standard Isolation Forest [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the two novel hybrid algorithms introduced in the paper are:

1.  **Subspace K-Means Isolation Forest**: This algorithm combines the random selection of an axis-parallel subspace with the clustering-based partitioning from K-Means IF. It works by first projecting the data into a randomly selected subspace and then applying the K-Means clustering algorithm to create the child nodes [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

2.  **Extended K-Means Isolation Forest (EKM-IF)**: This algorithm projects data onto random oblique hyperplanes before clustering, which combines the geometric flexibility of Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) with the density-aware partitioning of K-Means IF [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

These new methods were designed to integrate random projections with clustering to better capture complex, non-linear data distributions where standard methods might fail [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

Response:
The Probabilistic Generalization of Isolation Forest (PGIF) uses segment-cumulated probability to make the splitting of data more meaningful, increasing the likelihood that splits occur in the gaps between data clusters rather than within them [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. This approach is based on the assumption that outliers are typically separated from the majority of data by empty regions [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

The method works by implementing the following steps:

1.  **Assigning Probability to Segments:** PGIF builds a piecewise defined probability density function over the segments formed between neighboring data points. The core of the generalization is that the probability cumulated on a segment is made proportional to its length raised to the k-th power [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. This assigns a lower probability density to densely populated regions (clusters with short segments) and a higher probability density to out-of-cluster regions (gaps with long segments) [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. In the original Isolation Forest, the probability of a split is directly proportional to the segment's length, which makes splits across wide clusters more likely [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. PGIF becomes a special case of the original method when the power `k` is set to 0 and a uniform kernel is used [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

2.  **Generating the Split Value:** The procedure for generating a split value, `x_g`, uses the inverse cumulative probability function. First, the lengths of all segments are calculated, and each length is raised to a power. These values are then normalized by dividing each by their total sum, `s`, to ensure the probabilities for all segments sum to 1 [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. A random number, `c`, is drawn from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1. The algorithm then finds the specific segment where the cumulative probability matches the value of `c`, and the final split point `x_g` is calculated within that chosen segment [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

By assigning a higher probability density to the longer segments that separate outliers from clusters, it becomes more probable that an outlier will be isolated earlier in the tree-building process, resulting in a higher anomaly score [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

Response:
The paper introduces a family of aggregation functions `h_α(x) = 2^(−f_α(x))` for Isolation Forests, which are based on the functions `f_α` [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

The functions `f_α` are directly related to the α-Rényi divergence (`R_α`) from information theory through the identity:

`f_α(x) = exp(-R_α(x/||x||_1 || 1/n))`

where **1** is the vector of ones [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023]. The properties of the `f_α` functions, and by extension the aggregation functions `h_α`, are a direct consequence of the properties of the Rényi divergences [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023]. This connection is used to show that the aggregation functions `h_α` are monotonically increasing in the parameter α and interpolate between the standard Isolation Forest aggregation function and the maximum function [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

Response:
According to the provided text, non-uniform random splitting can improve the detection of "clustered" outliers, which are considered an interesting but difficult class to identify [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

Key points on the effect of non-uniform splitting are:

*   **Improved Identification:** Applying a non-uniformly-random choice of variables or split thresholds can make "clustered" diverse outliers more easily identifiable compared to the original iForest procedure of uniform random choice [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].
*   **Performance Edge:** For clustered outliers from multimodal datasets (such as "Arrythmia," "Satellite," and "Annthyroid"), non-uniformly-random splits provide an "edge," and models using them are better at identifying these anomalies [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021]. These outliers are often of "utmost interest" as they can originate from repeated processes like fraudulent activity [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].
*   **Trade-Offs:** This improved performance comes with a trade-off. A proposed non-uniform split heuristic was found to offer increased performance for clustered outliers but at the expense of "degraded performance in other classes of outliers" [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021]. This suggests that methods excelling at one type of outlier may not perform as well on others [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the Kernel Isolation Forest (KIFD) method is designed for anomaly detection in hyperspectral images (HSIs), which are also referred to as hyperspectral remotely sensed images [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

Hyperspectral images contain hundreds or thousands of spectral bands and are used in applications such as military defense, search-and-rescue, mine detection, and environmental monitoring. The goal of hyperspectral anomaly detection is to identify targets that are spatially or spectrally very different from their surrounding background, without any prior knowledge of the target's spectral signature [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019]. The proposed KIFD method is specifically developed to detect anomalies in these types of images [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019]. The paper evaluates the method on several real hyperspectral data sets, including one from the San Diego airport area captured by the AVIRIS spectrometer [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

In the context of the described Functional Isolation Forest (FIF) experiments, the 'visual elbow rule' is used to define the threshold for anomaly detection [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

After the FIF algorithm was run, the visual elbow rule helped set the threshold that successfully identified five digits from the majority class as anomalies because they did not resemble the other digits in their class [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

While other isolation forest variations use the elbow rule to find the optimal number of clusters or nodes at each tree split [K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020; A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025], its specific use in the provided FIF experiment was for defining the final anomaly detection threshold [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

Based on the provided context, the main advantage of Generalized Isolation Forest (GIF) over Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) is its significantly improved computational performance and reduced execution time [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

This speed advantage stems from GIF's ability to create trees without any empty branches, which is a known drawback of the EIF algorithm [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. EIF's strategy for selecting a separation hyperplane can lead to empty branches, which incurs additional computational overhead and increases tree complexity. GIF avoids this by selecting a hyperplane that is guaranteed to intersect the convex hull of the data, ensuring that it always partitions the data points into two non-empty subsets [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. The elimination of these empty branches is the primary reason for GIF's improved performance [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. Experimental results confirm that the time required to compute the forests is "significantly smaller for GIF compared to EIF" [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].
