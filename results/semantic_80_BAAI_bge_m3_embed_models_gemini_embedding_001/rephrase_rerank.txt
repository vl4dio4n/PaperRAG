Response:
Based on the provided context, the specific artifact that the standard Isolation Forest (IF) produces in anomaly score heat maps is the presence of horizontal and vertical lines or bands, which introduces a bias in the scoring [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

This artifact is caused by the standard algorithm's method of splitting data, which exclusively uses orthogonal hyperplanes parallel to the system's axes [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This "rectangular slicing" results in several undesirable effects [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]:

*   For a normally distributed dataset that should produce a circular score map, the standard IF creates a map with "rectangular regions of lower anomaly score in the x and y directions" [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This can appear as dark bands extending vertically and horizontally from the center, resembling a cross [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].
*   Along directions parallel to the axes, the anomaly score can remain low, incorrectly suggesting these are "normal regions" [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
*   This bias means that two data points of similar importance or at a similar distance from a nominal region can be assigned very different anomaly scores, reducing the algorithm's reliability [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].
*   On more complex data structures like a sinusoidal shape, the algorithm performs poorly, treating the data as a "large rectangular blob with horizontal and vertical bands emanating parallel to the coordinate axes" [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

The Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) aims to fix this artifact by generalizing the branching process. Instead of being restricted to axis-parallel cuts, EIF allows the slicing hyperplanes to have random slopes, which "completely resolves the bias" and remedies the artifact seen in the heat maps [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

Response:
The standard Isolation Forest (IF) algorithm introduces a bias because it constructs decision boundaries using orthogonal hyperplanes that are parallel to the coordinate axes [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. This restriction to horizontal and vertical branch cuts creates artifacts in the anomaly score map, seen as rectangular regions of incorrect scores. For example, for a centrally-located data blob, the anomaly score should increase uniformly in all radial directions, but standard IF produces lower scores along the axes compared to diagonal directions at the same distance from the center [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. This biased treatment can lead to inconsistent scoring for regions with similar anomalous properties [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) fixes this bias by generalizing the branching process to allow for hyperplanes with random slopes, rather than being restricted to axis-parallel cuts [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. This approach is considered a more robust and "truly general" fix compared to an alternative method of rotating the data before building each tree [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

The EIF mechanism works as follows at each branching point:
1.  A random normal vector `w` (which defines the slope) is selected. This is typically done by sampling a vector `u` from a standard normal distribution `N(0, I_d)` and then normalizing it: `w = u / ||u||₂` [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].
2.  A random intercept point `p` is selected from within the range of the data at that node [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].
3.  The data is then split into two branches based on the condition `(x − p)ᵀw ≤ 0` [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

By allowing the branch cuts to have any orientation, EIF "completely resolves the bias" and remedies the artifacts seen in the score maps of the standard algorithm [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This results in remarkably smaller variance in anomaly scores for points that should be similar, and EIF consistently performs better than standard IF on benchmark datasets [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. The algorithm can be generalized to `N` dimensions, where it offers `N-1` "extension levels." A higher extension level allows for more freedom in the orientation of the hyperplanes, with the lowest level (0th extension) being identical to the standard Isolation Forest [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Response:
In Functional Isolation Forest (FIF), data is projected to create features called "Split variables" which are used to build the isolation trees. This process involves a dictionary of functions and a scalar product [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

The projection is defined as `(x, d)_H`, which is the scalar product of an input function `x` with a function `d` selected from a dictionary `D`. This projection creates a single scalar feature that provides a partial description of the function `x` [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019]. The set of all possible projections onto the elements of the dictionary provides a rich representation of the data [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019]. During the construction of an isolation tree, a single function `d` (the *Split variable*) is randomly drawn from the dictionary `D` to split the data at a given node [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

The choice of dictionary and scalar product offers flexibility in detecting different types of anomalies:

*   **Dictionary (D)**: The dictionary is a set of functions chosen to be rich enough to explore various properties of the data. It can also be used to incorporate *a priori* or expert knowledge about the data's nature [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019]. Examples of dictionaries include the training data itself (Self-data dictionary), Cosine, or Mexican hat wavelet dictionaries [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].
*   **Scalar Product ((·,·)_H)**: The scalar product provides additional flexibility in what kind of anomalies are measured. An L2 scalar product helps detect "location anomalies," while an L2 scalar product of derivatives can detect "shape" anomalies. These can be combined to account for both location and shape deviations simultaneously [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

For multivariate functional data, the projection is extended by using a coordinate-wise sum of the scalar products for each of the `d` dimensions: `(f, g)_{H^⊗d} := ∑_{i=1}^d (f⁽ⁱ⁾, g⁽ⁱ⁾)_H` [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

Response:
Based on the provided context, Generalized Isolation Forest (GIF) improves upon Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) regarding empty branches by modifying how the splitting hyperplane is selected.

A significant limitation of EIF is that its method for selecting an intercept can lead to empty branches in a tree, which adds computational overhead and goes against the goal of efficiently isolating data points [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. This issue occurs in EIF because intercepts are sampled uniformly within the smallest axis-bounding hypercube that encloses the data. If an intercept is sampled outside the convex hull of the data, it can result in an empty branch [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. The probability of this happening increases with the number of dimensions due to the curse of dimensionality [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

GIF was developed to solve this problem by ensuring that every split results in two non-empty subsets of data [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. The GIF algorithm implements the following procedure:
1.  A random normal unit vector `w` is drawn [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
2.  All data points `x` are projected onto this vector via `xᵀw` [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
3.  The minimum (`p_min`) and maximum (`p_max`) values of these projections are identified [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
4.  A split value `p` is sampled uniformly from the interval between `p_min` and `p_max` [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

By sampling the split value between the minimum and maximum projections, GIF ensures the splitting hyperplane always passes through the convex hull of the data, which guarantees that there will be data points on each side of the split [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. For GIF, the probability of creating an empty branch is zero [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. The primary advantage of eliminating empty branches is improved computational performance, making GIF significantly faster than EIF while maintaining similar performance [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the K-Means Isolation Forest (K-Means IF) algorithm combines its partition strategy with the K-Means clustering algorithm through a density-aware approach at each node of the isolation tree [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

The process at each tree node is as follows:

1.  **Random Component Selection:** The algorithm first randomly selects a single attribute or component from the dataset [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].
2.  **Data Projection:** All data points at the current node are projected onto this single selected component [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
3.  **K-Means Clustering:** The K-Means clustering algorithm is then applied to the projected data to determine partition boundaries. The optimal number of clusters, `k`, is determined using the "elbow" rule [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].
4.  **Branch Creation:** This process creates a multi-branch tree structure, where the node creates `k` child nodes—one for each cluster identified by the K-Means algorithm [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. Data points are then assigned to the child node corresponding to the cluster they most likely belong to, based on the distance to the cluster's centroid [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

This method differs from the Standard Isolation Forest by not using purely random splits. Instead, it utilizes K-Means clustering to allow the tree structure to adapt to the local data density [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. Because the clustering is performed on a single randomly selected attribute, the resulting separation boundaries are effectively hyperplanes orthogonal to that coordinate axis [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. This approach aims to create more "intuitive" divisions that relate to the data's natural clustering [K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the two novel hybrid algorithms introduced in the "Extended K-Means Isolation Forest" paper are:

1.  **Subspace K-Means IF**: This algorithm projects data into random axis-parallel subspaces before the clustering step. It is a hybrid method that combines the random subspace selection with the clustering-based partitioning of K-Means IF [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

2.  **Extended K-Means Isolation Forest (EKM-IF)**: This algorithm projects data onto random oblique hyperplanes prior to clustering. It combines the geometric flexibility of Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) with the density adaptability of K-Means IF [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

These two methods were introduced to extend the density-aware partitioning of K-Means IF to better handle complex, non-linear data distributions and address its limitations in high-dimensional spaces [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

Response:
The Probabilistic Generalization of Isolation Forest (PGIF) uses segment-cumulated probability to make the splitting of data more meaningful, ensuring that splits are more likely to occur between clusters rather than through them [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. The core idea is that normal data points are close together in clusters, while outliers are separated by wider gaps [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

PGIF implements this by assigning different probabilities to various regions of the data space. It builds a piecewise defined probability density function on the segments between neighboring points of the training data [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. In this generalization, the probability cumulated on a segment is made proportional to its length raised to the k-th power [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. This gives a higher probability density to the wider, out-of-cluster gaps where anomalies are expected, and a lower probability density to the densely populated cluster regions [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

The procedure for generating a split value (`x_g`) is modified to use this probabilistic model. First, a random number `c` between 0 and 1 is drawn from a uniform distribution. Then, `x_g` is generated using an inverse cumulative probability function such that `P(x ≤ x_g) = c` [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. The cumulative probability function is constructed by summing the probabilities of individual segments (`P_i`). The calculation is expressed as `P(x ≤ x_g) = ∑^{m-1}_{i=1} P_i + ∫^{x_g}_{x_m} p_m(x)dx`, where the formula sums the probabilities of all segments before the one containing `x_g` and adds the integrated probability within that final segment [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. This process ensures that splits are more likely to happen in the longer segments between clusters, leading to earlier isolation of outliers [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

Based on the provided context, the aggregation functions, denoted as `h_α`, are related to the Rényi divergence through an intermediate family of functions, `f_α` [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

The relationship is established in two steps:
1.  The aggregation functions `h_α` are defined as `h_α(x) = 2^(−f_α(x))` [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].
2.  The functions `f_α` are linked to the α-Rényi divergence, `R_α`, via the identity: `f_α(x) = exp(-R_α(x/||x||_1 || 1/n))`, where **1** is the vector of ones [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

This connection is used to demonstrate the properties of the `f_α` functions, as they are a direct consequence of the properties of the Rényi divergences [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

Response:
According to the 'Revisiting randomized choices' paper, applying non-uniformly-random choices for splitting variables and/or thresholds can make "clustered" outliers more easily identifiable [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

The paper highlights that clustered outliers from multi-modal datasets are often the most difficult to detect but also of the "utmost interest." In these cases, non-uniformly-random splits provide an "edge" [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021]. The paper proposes a specific non-uniform split guiding heuristic called FCF, which uses a pooled information gain metric. This method was found to offer increased performance for detecting clustered outliers by creating splits that represent more "natural separations," which is especially useful in multi-modal distributions [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

However, this improved performance for clustered outliers comes at the expense of "degraded performance in other classes of outliers," suggesting a trade-off where a single universal outlier detector may not be the best approach [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the 'visual elbow rule' is used to define the threshold for anomaly detection in a Functional Isolation Forest (FIF) experiment involving handwritten digits [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

More generally, the "elbow-rule" is a heuristic method used to find an optimal number of clusters for a dataset. It works by plotting a clustering error metric, like the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE), against an increasing number of clusters (`k`). The plot typically shows a sharp initial decrease that then flattens out, resembling an arm. The "elbow" is the point on this curve where the rate of decrease slows significantly, indicating a point of diminishing returns for adding more clusters [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].

In the context of K-Means based Isolation Forests (a variant of the standard algorithm), the elbow rule is used at each node in a tree to find the optimal number of clusters for the data points at that split, which in turn determines the number of branches originating from that node [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022; K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].

Response:
The main computational advantage of Generalized Isolation Forest (GIF) over Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) is its significantly faster execution time, which is achieved by eliminating the creation of empty branches during the tree-building process [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

A significant limitation of EIF is its method for selecting intercepts, which can result in branches that lead to empty nodes. The generation of these empty branches incurs additional computational overhead and increases the complexity of the trees in the forest [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. This issue is particularly pronounced as the tree depth and the number of dimensions increase [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

GIF addresses this problem by modifying how the separation hyperplane is selected. Instead of sampling within a hypercube that encloses the data, GIF selects a hyperplane that is guaranteed to pass through the convex hull of the data. This is achieved by projecting the data onto a random unit vector and then selecting a split value uniformly between the minimum and maximum projection values [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. This strategy ensures that the data is always partitioned into two non-empty subsets, thus avoiding empty branches entirely [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

As a result of eliminating empty branches, GIF demonstrates "improved computational performance," and experiments show that the time required to create the forests is "significantly smaller for GIF compared to EIF" [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
