Response:
Based on the provided context, the standard Isolation Forest produces artifacts in its anomaly score heat maps that appear as rectangular bands aligned with the coordinate axes [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

These artifacts manifest in several ways:
*   For a single, circular cluster of data points, the anomaly score map should be circular. Instead, the standard Isolation Forest produces a map with "rectangular regions of lower anomaly score in the x and y directions," creating an artifact that resembles a cross or a rounded square rather than a circle [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].
*   When multiple data clusters are present, these rectangular bands extend from each cluster center. At the intersection of these bands, the artifact is amplified, creating artificial "ghost" clusters in areas where no data exists [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].
*   These artifacts can cause serious problems, such as misclassifying an anomalous data point as nominal if it happens to fall within one of these artificial low-score regions. This also wrongly indicates a non-existent structure in the data [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

The underlying cause of this issue is that the standard Isolation Forest's branching procedure slices data using hyperplanes that are always parallel to the coordinate axes. The Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) is designed to fix this by allowing its branching hyperplanes to take on any slope, which completely resolves this bias and eliminates the rectangular bands and ghost clusters [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the standard Isolation Forest algorithm suffers from a bias caused by its branching procedure [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This procedure slices data using hyperplanes that are always parallel to the coordinate frame (i.e., horizontal or vertical cuts) [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. This introduces "artificial zones of higher/lower scores" and a high variance in anomaly scores, particularly in regions where anomalies are likely to be found [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) fixes this bias by generalizing the branching process. Instead of being restricted to axis-parallel cuts, EIF allows the branching hyperplanes to have random slopes [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This is accomplished by selecting two pieces of information for each branch cut:
1.  A random slope, which is determined by choosing a normal vector ($\vec{n}$) uniformly over the unit N-Sphere for an N-dimensional dataset [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].
2.  A random intercept ($\vec{p}$), which is chosen from a uniform distribution over the range of data values present at that specific branching point [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

The data is then split based on whether a data point $\vec{x}$ satisfies the condition $(\vec{x} − \vec{p}) \cdot \vec{n} \le 0$ [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

By allowing branch cuts in any direction, EIF "completely resolves the bias introduced in the case of standard Isolation Forest" [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This results in more robust measurements and "remarkably smaller variances" in anomaly scores compared to the standard algorithm, especially for data in regions of high anomaly likelihood [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. The EIF consistently performed better than the standard Isolation Forest across all benchmark datasets considered [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Response:
The Functional Isolation Forest (FIF) algorithm projects functional data to create splits when building its trees. This is achieved through the combined use of a dictionary and a scalar product [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

The projection process is a core part of the node-splitting procedure in a Functional Isolation Tree (F-itree):

1.  **Select a Split Variable:** For a given node, a "Split variable" `d` is chosen from a dictionary `D`. This dictionary is a set of functions designed to be rich enough to explore various properties of the data [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].
2.  **Project the Data:** Each function `x` in the node is projected onto the chosen dictionary element `d`. This projection is calculated using a scalar product, denoted as `(x, d)_H`, which results in a single real value that serves as a feature partially describing the function `x` [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019]. For multivariate functional data, the projection is the coordinate-wise sum of the scalar products for each dimension [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].
3.  **Select a Split Value:** A "Split value" `κ` is then drawn uniformly from the interval defined by the minimum and maximum projection values for all the data points currently in that node [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].
4.  **Partition the Data:** The node is split into two children based on the projection values. One child contains functions `x` where `(x, d)_H ≤ κ`, and the other contains functions where `(x, d)_H > κ` [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

The choice of both the dictionary and the scalar product provides flexibility in detecting different types of anomalies [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].
*   **Dictionaries:** A variety of dictionaries can be used, such as the *Mexican hat wavelet dictionary* (MHW), *Brownian motion dictionary* (B), *cosine dictionary* (Cos), or even the training dataset itself (*self-data dictionary*) [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].
*   **Scalar Products:** The scalar product can also be chosen to target specific anomalies. For instance, an L2 scalar product helps detect "location anomalies," while an L2 scalar product of derivatives can detect "shape" anomalies. These can also be combined, such as in a Sobolev scalar product, to detect a wider variety of deviations from normal data [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the assumption that anomalies are more susceptible to isolation relies on the fundamental principles of the Isolation Forest (iForest) algorithm, which is then applied within a kernel-induced feature space [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

The core assumptions are as follows:

1.  **Anomalies are "rare and different"**: The iForest method is based on the premise that anomaly instances are typically rare and spectrally different from normal background instances. This inherent difference makes them "more susceptible to isolation" when data is recursively partitioned in a binary tree structure [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019]. In other words, anomalous pixels can be separated from the rest of the data with fewer partitions, resulting in shorter path lengths in the isolation trees [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

2.  **Kernel methods enhance separability**: Kernel methods are used to project data into a "potentially much higher dimensional feature space" [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019]. The purpose of this projection is the hope that classes that are not linearly separable in the original data space will become linearly separable in the new, higher-dimensional space [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

By combining these two concepts, the Kernel Isolation Forest-based hyperspectral anomaly Detection (KIFD) method first maps the data into the kernel space. It then applies the iForest algorithm, which detects anomalies by identifying the pixels that can be isolated easily within this new feature space. The KIFD method can "well capture the isolation property of anomaly objects" by performing the isolation process in this higher-dimensional space where separability is potentially increased [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

Response:
Based on the provided context, Generalized Isolation Forest (GIF) improves upon Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) by changing how the splitting hyperplane is selected to guarantee that no empty branches are created in the decision trees [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

A significant drawback of EIF is that its intercept selection strategy can lead to empty branches. In EIF, an intercept point for the splitting hyperplane is sampled uniformly from the smallest axis-bounding hypercube that contains all the data points [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. This can result in a hyperplane where all data points fall on one side, leaving the other branch of the tree empty [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. The probability of this occurring increases with data dimensionality and creates computational overhead [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

GIF addresses this issue by modifying the selection process. Instead of sampling within a hypercube, GIF first projects the data points onto a random normal vector. It then computes the minimum and maximum values of these projections and samples a split value uniformly *between* these two extremes [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. This method is equivalent to selecting a hyperplane that passes through the convex hull of the data, which ensures that the data is partitioned into two non-empty subsets [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. As a result, GIF eliminates empty branches, leading to improved computational performance compared to EIF [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

Response:
The K-Means Isolation Forest (K-Means IF) algorithm integrates a density-aware partitioning strategy by using K-Means clustering to define the branches at each node of an isolation tree, moving away from the purely random splits of the Standard Isolation Forest [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].

The process at each tree node is as follows:
1.  A single component (or attribute) is randomly selected [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
2.  All data points in the current node are projected onto this selected component [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
3.  The K-Means clustering algorithm is then applied to this one-dimensional data to determine the partition boundaries. The number of clusters, *k*, is determined using the "elbow rule" [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
4.  Each data point is assigned to the cluster it most likely belongs to based on its distance to the cluster's centroid [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
5.  This creates a node with *k* child nodes, one for each identified cluster, resulting in a multi-branch tree structure rather than the strictly binary tree of the Standard IF [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].

This method is considered more intuitive because it divides the data in relation to its local density and structure, unlike the Standard IF which is insensitive to naturally observable clusters [K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020]. Because the clustering is performed on data projected onto a single random component, the resulting separation boundaries are effectively hyperplanes that are orthogonal to the coordinate axes [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the Probabilistic Generalization of Isolation Forest (PGIF) uses segment-cumulated probability to make the process of splitting data more effective and meaningful [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. The generalization is founded on the "nonlinear dependence of segment-cumulated probability from the length of segment" [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

The core idea is to modify how split points are generated during the construction of an isolation tree. Instead of using a uniform distribution like the original Isolation Forest, PGIF assigns different probabilities to different regions of the data space [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. Specifically, it assigns a lower probability density to densely populated regions (clusters) and a higher probability density to the "out-of-cluster" spaces or gaps where anomalies are presumed to be located [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

This is achieved by building an empirical probability distribution where the probability density on segments is proportional to their lengths [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. The generalization introduces a dependency using the k-th power of a segment's length [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. Consequently, a long segment, such as a gap separating an outlier from the main data, receives a higher total probability weight. This makes it more likely that a split will occur within these gaps, allowing outliers to be isolated earlier in the tree-building process, which in turn gives them a higher anomaly score [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

This approach contrasts with the original Isolation Forest, where a uniform distribution makes it more probable that a split occurs across a wide cluster rather than a narrower inter-cluster gap [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the Rényi divergence is used to provide an information-theoretic motivation and foundation for a generalized family of aggregation functions, denoted as `h_α`, which are a contribution to the Isolation Forest method [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

The relationship is established through an intermediate function, `f_α`. The aggregation functions `h_α` are defined as `h_α(x) = 2^{−f_α(x)}` [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023]. The function `f_α` is then directly linked to the α-Rényi divergence (`R_α`) through the following identity:

`f_α(x) = exp(-R_α(\frac{x}{||x||_1} || \frac{1}{n}))`

In this equation, `x` is the vector of per-estimator scores, and **1** is the vector of ones [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023]. The properties of the aggregation functions `h_α`, such as their monotonicity, are a "direct consequence of the properties of the Renyi divergences" [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023]. This connection provides an "information-theoretically motivated generalisation" for aggregating scores across the random tree estimators in an Isolation Forest [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

Response:
According to the provided paper, applying a non-uniformly-random choice of variables and/or thresholds can help to more easily identify "clustered" diverse outliers, which are often a more interesting class of outliers [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

The paper notes that for clustered outliers from multimodal datasets—which are frequently of "utmost interest but also the hardest to flag"—tree-based models with non-uniformly-random splits provide an "edge" [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021]. A distinction is made between "scattered" outliers (originating from unrelated events) and "clustered" outliers (originating from a repeated process like fraudulent activity), with the latter being considered more "interesting" and harder to identify [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

The paper's proposed FCF algorithm, which uses a non-uniform guiding heuristic, was found to offer increased performance for these clustered outliers. However, this improvement comes at the expense of degraded performance for other types of outliers, such as those of minority-in-binary-classes [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021]. This suggests a trade-off where different methods should be employed for different types of outliers [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

Response:
The main computational advantage of Generalized Isolation Forest (GIF) over Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) is that it is significantly faster because it avoids creating "empty branches" during the tree-building process [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

A significant limitation of EIF is that its method for selecting a random hyperplane can result in branches that do not partition the data, leading to empty nodes. This is a common inefficiency, and the probability of it occurring increases with the tree's depth, adding computational overhead [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. GIF addresses this issue by refining the splitting process. Instead of selecting a random hyperplane that might miss the data, GIF selects a hyperplane that is guaranteed to pass through the convex hull of the data. This ensures that the data is always partitioned into two non-empty subsets, eliminating the inefficiency of empty branches and improving computational speed [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

Experiments show that the time required to compute the forests is "significantly smaller for GIF compared to EIF" [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. However, one source notes that this speed advantage can be implementation-dependent. While an efficient GIF implementation was found to be an order of magnitude faster than the original EIF implementation, a re-implemented and speed-optimized version of EIF was an order of magnitude faster than GIF [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].
