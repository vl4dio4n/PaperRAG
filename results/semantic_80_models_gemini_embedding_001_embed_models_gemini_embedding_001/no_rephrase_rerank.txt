Response:
Based on the provided context, the standard Isolation Forest produces artifacts in anomaly score heat maps due to its branching procedure, which only creates cuts parallel to the coordinate axes [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This introduces a bias that results in artificial zones of high or low scores not present in the original data [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

These specific artifacts manifest in several ways:

*   **Rectangular Bands:** For a single, circular cluster of data points, the standard Isolation Forest produces an anomaly map with "rectangular regions" or "bands" extending horizontally and vertically from the data's center. This creates a cross-like artifact instead of the expected circular score map [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. For more structured data, such as a sinusoidal distribution, the algorithm incorrectly treats it as "one large rectangular blob with horizontal and vertical bands" [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].
*   **"Ghost" Clusters:** When there are multiple data clusters, the rectangular bands emanate from each cluster's center. The intersection of these bands creates artificial low-score regions referred to as "ghost clusters" [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. These ghost clusters are problematic because they wrongly indicate a non-existent structure in the data and can cause an anomalous point falling in that region to be misclassified as nominal [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) aims to fix this by allowing its branching hyperplanes to take on any slope, not just those parallel to the coordinate axes. This extension "completely resolves the bias" and eliminates the rectangular bands and "ghost" regions, resulting in score maps that better preserve the true structure of the data [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the standard Isolation Forest algorithm suffers from a bias because its branching procedure slices data using only axis-parallel cuts, which are always horizontal or vertical [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This introduces artificial zones of high or low anomaly scores depending on the data point's location relative to the coordinate frame [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

To fix this issue, the authors proposed two approaches, with the Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) being the preferred and more robust method [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. The EIF algorithm remedies the bias by modifying and generalizing the branching process. Instead of being restricted to axis-parallel cuts, EIF allows the slicing hyperplanes to have random slopes [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This is achieved at each branching node by selecting a random normal vector and a random intercept point to define the data split [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This extension completely resolves the bias introduced by the standard Isolation Forest, leading to more robust anomaly scores with significantly smaller variance [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

The standard Isolation Forest is considered a special case of EIF, corresponding to an "extension level" of zero where the hyperplanes are parallel to the axes [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Response:
In the Functional Isolation Forest (FIF) algorithm, data is projected onto elements of a chosen dictionary `D` to create features that describe the data [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019]. This projection of a function `x` onto a dictionary element `d` is defined by their scalar product, `(x, d)_H`. This result is a feature, or "Split variable," that partially describes the function `x` [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019]. A collection of these Split variables, generated by using the entire dictionary, creates a rich representation of the functional data [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

The choice of the scalar product provides flexibility, allowing the algorithm to detect different kinds of anomalies [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019]. For example:
*   An `L_2` scalar product allows for the detection of "location anomalies" [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].
*   An `L_2` scalar product of the derivatives can detect "shape anomalies" [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].
*   A combined scalar product can be used as a compromise to detect both location and shape anomalies simultaneously [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

For multivariate functional data, where an observation consists of `d` functions, the projection is extended by using the coordinate-wise sum of the corresponding scalar products. The formula for this projection is `(f, g)_{H^⊗d} := ∑_{i=1}^d (f⁽ⁱ⁾, g⁽ⁱ⁾)_H` [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the fundamental assumption of the Isolation Forest (iForest) algorithm is that anomalies are "few and different" or "rare and different" from normal instances [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022; Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019]. This characteristic makes them more susceptible to isolation within binary tree structures [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019]. Anomalies are expected to be in sparsely populated regions of the feature space, far from inliers, and therefore require fewer random partitions to be isolated, resulting in shorter average path lengths in the decision trees [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

The Kernel Isolation Forest paper applies this same principle after first mapping the data into a new feature space using a kernel method. Kernel methods project data into a higher-dimensional space where classes may become more linearly separable [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019]. The paper proposes a procedure where hyperspectral data is first transformed into this kernel space, and then iForest is used to detect the anomalies [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019]. While the text states that this preprocessing step plays an "important role in further improving the detection performance," it does not explicitly detail why anomalies are assumed to be more susceptible to isolation *specifically in the kernel space* beyond the general principle of the iForest algorithm itself [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

Response:
Generalized Isolation Forest (GIF) improves upon Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) by employing a different strategy for creating splitting hyperplanes that guarantees no empty branches are created in the isolation trees [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

A significant drawback of EIF is that its method of selecting a random hyperplane can result in splits where all data points fall on one side, leaving the other branch empty [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. These empty branches occur when EIF samples an intercept point that falls outside the convex hull of the data but inside the axis-bounding hypercube [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. The probability of generating empty branches increases with the number of dimensions and adds computational overhead and complexity to the trees [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

To solve this, GIF modifies the splitting process. The steps are as follows:
1.  A random normal unit vector is sampled [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
2.  All data points are projected onto this vector [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
3.  Instead of sampling an intercept from a large volume, GIF finds the minimum and maximum values among these projections [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].
4.  A split value is then sampled uniformly *only* between these minimum and maximum projection values [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

This strategy ensures that the separating hyperplane always passes through the convex hull of the data, which guarantees that the data points are partitioned into two non-empty subsets [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. By eliminating empty branches, GIF significantly improves execution times compared to EIF while achieving similar performance [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

Response:
The K-Means Isolation Forest (K-Means IF) algorithm combines a partitioning strategy with K-Means clustering by using the clustering algorithm to define the branches at each node of an isolation tree, creating a density-aware, multi-branch structure [Vlad Birsan, 2025; Karczmarek et al., 2020].

The process at each node is as follows:
1.  **Random Projection**: First, the algorithm randomly selects a single component (or dimension) [Vlad Birsan, 2025].
2.  **K-Means Clustering**: All data points at the current node are projected onto this selected component. The K-Means clustering algorithm is then applied to this projected data to identify partition boundaries. The optimal number of clusters, `k`, is determined using the "elbow rule" [Vlad Birsan, 2025].
3.  **Branch Creation**: The node is then split into `k` child nodes, one for each cluster identified by the K-Means algorithm. This contrasts with the standard Isolation Forest, which only creates two branches [Vlad Birsan, 2025; Karczmarek et al., 2020]. Data points are assigned to the child node corresponding to the cluster they most likely belong to, based on their distance to the cluster's centroid [Vlad Birsan, 2025].

This approach allows the tree structure to adapt to the local density of the data, creating partitions that align with natural clusters rather than using purely random splits [Vlad Birsan, 2025; Karczmarek et al., 2020]. The resulting trees are "wider" but not as deep as those in the standard Isolation Forest [Karczmarek et al., 2020]. This method is considered a hybrid of isolation and density-based anomaly detection, providing "geometrically faithful isolation boundaries" [Vlad Birsan, 2025].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the two novel hybrid algorithms introduced in the paper are **Subspace K-Means Isolation Forest** and **Extended K-Means Isolation Forest (EKM-IF)** [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

These algorithms are described as follows:

1.  **Subspace K-Means Isolation Forest**: This method combines random subspace selection with the clustering-based partitioning of K-Means IF. At each tree node, it first selects a random number of components (between 1 and the total number of dimensions) and projects the data into the axis-parallel subspace defined by these components before applying clustering [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

2.  **Extended K-Means Isolation Forest (EKM-IF)**: This algorithm projects data onto random oblique hyperplanes before the clustering step. Instead of projecting onto a single axis or an axis-parallel subspace, it projects the data into a general subspace using a random normal projection matrix. This approach combines the "geometric flexibility of EIF with the density adaptability of K-Means IF" [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

Response:
The Probabilistic Generalization of Isolation Forest (PGIF) uses segment-cumulated probability to make the process of splitting data more effective for anomaly detection [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov, 2022]. The method is based on the assumption that outliers are located in the relatively wide gaps that separate dense clusters of normal data points [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov, 2022].

Unlike the original Isolation Forest, which uses a uniform distribution where the probability of a split is proportional to a segment's length, PGIF introduces a non-linear approach. It constructs a piecewise defined probability density function where the probability cumulated on a segment is proportional to the segment's length raised to the k-th power [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov, 2022].

This generalization assigns a lower probability density to densely populated regions (clusters) and a higher probability density to the out-of-cluster regions or gaps [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov, 2022]. By giving a higher probability weight to the gaps between clusters, splits are more likely to occur there. This is considered more "profitable" as it allows outliers to be isolated earlier in the tree-building process, leading to a higher anomaly score [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov, 2022]. In essence, PGIF builds an empirical probability distribution from the training data to ensure more meaningful splits that occur between clusters rather than through them [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov, 2022].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the Rényi divergence relates to the aggregation functions through an intermediate set of functions, denoted as `f_α` [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

The relationship is established in a few steps:
1.  The paper introduces a family of aggregation functions `h_α`, which are defined in terms of `f_α` as: `h_α(x) = 2^(−f_α(x))` [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].
2.  The functions `f_α` are directly linked to the α-Rényi divergence, `R_α`, via the identity: `f_α(x) = exp(-R_α(x/||x||_1 || 1/n))`, where **1** represents a vector of ones [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].
3.  The purpose of this connection to information theory is to demonstrate the properties of the `f_α` and `h_α` functions. The authors state that the claimed properties of `f_α` are a "direct consequence of the properties of the Renyi divergences" [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023]. This connection is used to show that the aggregation functions `h_α` are monotonically increasing in the parameter α [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

Response:
According to the paper, applying a non-uniformly-random choice of variables and/or thresholds can help to more easily identify "clustered" diverse outliers [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

These clustered outliers, which can originate from repeated processes like fraudulent activity, are often considered the most interesting but also the hardest to detect [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021]. The paper finds that in multimodal datasets containing this type of outlier, tree-based models perform better, with non-uniformly-random splits providing an "edge" in identification [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

The proposed guiding heuristic in the paper, which is a form of non-uniform split selection, offered increased performance for these clustered outliers. However, this improvement came at the expense of degraded performance for other types of outliers [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

Hyperspectral images are described as remotely sensed images that contain hundreds or even thousands of spectral bands.

Response:
Based on the provided context, the main advantage of Generalized Isolation Forest (GIF) over Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) is its significantly improved computational performance and faster execution time [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

This speed advantage stems from how each algorithm constructs its decision trees. The EIF algorithm's strategy for selecting random hyperplanes can generate empty branches, which increases the complexity of the trees and adds computational overhead [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. As tree depth increases, the probability of creating these inefficient empty branches rises [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

GIF was designed specifically to overcome this issue. It modifies the selection of the separation hyperplane to ensure it always passes through the convex hull of the data. This guarantees that the data points are always partitioned into two non-empty subsets, thus eliminating the creation of empty branches [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. By avoiding this drawback of EIF, GIF achieves significantly reduced execution times for creating the forest [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

However, one source notes that this speed advantage can be dependent on the specific software implementation. While one analysis reported GIF running an order of magnitude faster than EIF, a separate study using a reimplemented, speed-focused version of EIF found the opposite, with their EIF being an order of magnitude faster than GIF [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].
