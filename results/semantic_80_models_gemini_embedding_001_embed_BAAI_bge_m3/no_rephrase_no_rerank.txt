Response:
Based on the provided context, the standard Isolation Forest produces several specific artifacts in anomaly score heat maps that the Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) is designed to fix:

*   **Axis-Aligned Bands:** For a simple, single cluster of data that should produce a circular score map, the standard Isolation Forest creates artificial horizontal and vertical bands of inconsistent scores [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. These bands appear as "rectangular regions of lower anomaly score" extending along the x and y directions, creating a cross-like pattern instead of the expected symmetric, circular map [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This artifact is a result of the algorithm's branching procedure, which only slices data using cuts parallel to the coordinate axes, introducing a bias [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

*   **"Ghost" Clusters:** In datasets with multiple clusters, these axis-aligned bands can intersect. At these intersections, the artifact is amplified, creating artificial zones of low anomaly scores referred to as "'ghost' clusters" or "'ghost' regions" where no data actually exists [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This can cause a truly anomalous point falling in one of these "ghost" regions to be incorrectly classified as nominal [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

*   **Poor Structure Detection:** For data with a more complex structure, such as a sinusoidal pattern, the standard Isolation Forest fails to capture the underlying shape. Instead, it treats the data as "one large rectangular blob with horizontal and vertical bands emanating parallel to the coordinate axes" [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

These artifacts are problematic because they can lead to the miscategorization of data points, reduce the algorithm's reliability, and wrongly indicate non-existent structures in the data [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. The Extended Isolation Forest resolves these issues by allowing data to be sliced using hyperplanes with random slopes, not just those parallel to the coordinate frame, which eliminates the bias and the resulting artifacts [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Response:
The standard Isolation Forest algorithm suffers from a bias that originates from its branching procedure [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This procedure involves recursively splitting the data by selecting a random feature and then a random value along that feature's axis. This creates splits, or "branch cuts," that are always parallel to the coordinate axes [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. This axis-parallel approach can lead to artifacts in the anomaly score maps, where the data is treated like a "large rectangular blob" with bands parallel to the axes. This results in inconsistent anomaly scores and artificial zones of higher or lower scores that are not present in the original data [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) fixes this bias by generalizing the branching process to allow branch cuts to occur in any direction, not just parallel to the coordinate axes [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. This is the preferred of two proposed methods to remedy the issue [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

The EIF mechanism modifies the branching criteria. Instead of selecting a random feature and a random value, EIF selects two different pieces of information at each branching point [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]:
1.  A random slope for the branch cut, which is equivalent to choosing a random normal vector.
2.  A random intercept for the branch cut, chosen from the range of available data values.

By using these hyperplanes with random slopes, EIF completely resolves the bias found in the standard algorithm [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This approach eliminates the "ghost regions" and rectangular artifacts seen in the standard Isolation Forest's score maps [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. As a result, EIF produces more robust and stable anomaly scores with significantly smaller variance, especially in regions of high anomaly, without an appreciable difference in computation time [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. The standard Isolation Forest is considered a special case of EIF, specifically the "0th extension" level where the random slices are always parallel to the axes [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Response:
The Functional Isolation Forest (FIF) algorithm projects functional data onto elements of a dictionary using a scalar product to create one-dimensional features, which are then used to split the data [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

The process is as follows:
*   **Projection:** To handle the infinite dimensionality of functional data, FIF projects an observation `x` onto an element `d` from a chosen dictionary `D`. This projection is defined by the scalar product `(x, d)_H`, which results in a real-valued feature that partially describes the function `x` [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].
*   **Split Variables:** The set of all possible projections, using every function in the dictionary `D`, creates a set of candidate "Split variables". From this set, one split variable `d` is selected to partition the data at a given node in a Functional Isolation Tree [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].
*   **Split Value:** After a split variable `d` is chosen, a "Split value" is drawn uniformly from the range of values produced by projecting the observations in the current node onto `d` [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

The choice of the scalar product adds flexibility, allowing the algorithm to detect different kinds of anomalies. For example, an L₂ scalar product helps detect "location anomalies," whereas an L₂ scalar product of derivatives is suited for detecting "shape anomalies" [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019]. A combined scalar product can also be used to account for both, such as `(f, g) := α × (f,g)_{L_2} / (||f|| ||g||) + (1 − α) × (f', g')_{L_2} / (||f'|| ||g'||)` [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

FIF can be extended to multivariate functional data. For data with `d` dimensions, the projection is calculated using the coordinate-wise sum of the scalar products for each component: `(f, g)_{H^⊗d} := ∑_{i=1}^d (f⁽ⁱ⁾, g⁽ⁱ⁾)_H` [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the Generalized Isolation Forest (GIF) improves upon the Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) by changing how the separation hyperplane is selected, which guarantees that no empty branches are created in the isolation trees [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

A significant limitation of EIF is that its method for selecting intercepts can result in branches leading to empty nodes [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. This happens because EIF samples intercepts within the axis-bounding hypercube of the data, which can fall outside the convex hull of the actual data points. When a hyperplane is chosen this way, it is possible for all data points to fall on one side, leaving the other branch of the tree empty [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. This issue can lead to a loss of information and increases the complexity and computational overhead of the trees, especially as tree depth increases [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

GIF was introduced to overcome this specific issue [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. Instead of sampling within the entire hypercube, GIF's strategy is equivalent to reducing the sampling volume to the convex hull of the data [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. The algorithm works as follows:
1.  A random normal unit vector is sampled [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
2.  All data points are projected onto this vector [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
3.  The minimum and maximum values of these projections are identified [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
4.  A split value is then sampled uniformly *between* these minimum and maximum values [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

This process ensures that the separation hyperplane intersects the convex hull, which guarantees that the data points are partitioned into two non-empty subsets [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. By ensuring there is at least one data point in each branch (one associated with the minimum projected value and another with the maximum), GIF eliminates the possibility of empty branches [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

The primary advantage of this improvement is enhanced computational performance; by eliminating empty branches, GIF is significantly faster than EIF while maintaining similar performance in anomaly detection [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

Response:
The K-Means Isolation Forest (K-Means IF) algorithm combines its partitioning strategy with K-Means clustering by using a density-aware approach at each node of an isolation tree, moving away from the purely random, axis-parallel splits of the Standard Isolation Forest [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].

The process at each tree node is as follows:

1.  **Random Component Selection and Projection**: Instead of choosing a random split value, the algorithm first randomly selects a single component (attribute) [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. All data points at the current node are then projected onto this single dimension [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
2.  **Clustering**: The K-Means clustering algorithm is applied to the one-dimensional projected data to determine partition boundaries [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. The optimal number of clusters, `k`, is determined using a heuristic called the "elbow-rule," which identifies the point where increasing `k` offers only marginal improvement to the clustering [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].
3.  **Branching**: The `k` clusters identified by the K-Means algorithm define the branches for the current node. Consequently, the node will have `k` child nodes, resulting in a multi-branch tree rather than the strictly binary one used in the original Isolation Forest [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].
4.  **Data Assignment**: Each data point is assigned to one of the `k` child nodes based on which cluster it belongs to. This assignment is determined by the point's Euclidean distance to the nearest cluster centroid [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

This method, introduced by Karczmarek et al., represents a hybrid approach combining isolation and density-based anomaly detection methods [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020]. By allowing the tree structure to adapt to the local data density, it aims to produce more intuitive partitions and anomaly scores [K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].

Response:
The Probabilistic Generalization of Isolation Forest (PGIF) algorithm uses segment-cumulated probability to generate more effective data splits, addressing a limitation of the original Isolation Forest (IF) which uses a uniform distribution [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. In the original IF, the probability of a split occurring in a segment depends solely on its length, making splits across wide, dense clusters more likely than splits across narrower, inter-cluster gaps [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

PGIF enhances this process by assigning probability densities to different regions in a non-uniform way, with the goal of making splits more likely to occur in the sparsely populated regions between clusters rather than through them [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

The mechanism works as follows:

1.  **Piecewise Probability Function:** PGIF constructs a piecewise probability density function over the segments formed by neighboring points in the training data. This is achieved using Kernel Density Estimation functions [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

2.  **Probability Proportional to Segment Length:** The core idea is the "nonlinear dependence of segment-cumulated probability from the length of segment" [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. The probability cumulated on a segment is made proportional to its length raised to the k-th power [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. This ensures that longer segments, which typically represent gaps between clusters, are assigned a higher probability density, while shorter segments within dense clusters receive a lower density [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

3.  **Generating a Split Value:** To generate a split value, the algorithm first calculates the cumulated probability for each segment. It then draws a random number and loops through the segments, subtracting each segment's probability from the random number until the target segment for the split is identified [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. Finally, an inverted cumulative probability function is used to calculate the precise split value within that chosen segment [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

By assigning a higher probability to the gaps separating outliers from other data, this method makes it more likely that an outlier is isolated earlier in the tree-building process, thus receiving a higher anomaly score [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the aggregation functions `h_α` are related to the Rényi divergence through an intermediate function, `f_α` [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

The relationship is established as follows:
1.  A family of aggregation functions, denoted as `h_α(x)`, is defined by the equation `h_α(x) = 2^(−f_α(x))` [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].
2.  The function `f_α(x)` is directly linked to the α-Rényi divergence (`R_α`) from information theory via the identity: `f_α(x) = exp(-R_α(x/||x||_1 || 1/n))`, where `R_α(p||q)` is the α-Rényi divergence and **1** is the vector of ones [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].
3.  The α-Rényi divergence for `α ∈ (0, 1) ∪ (1,∞)` is defined as `R_α(p||q) = (1/(α-1)) * ln Σ(p_i^α * q_i^(1-α))` [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

Therefore, the properties of the aggregation functions `h_α` are a "direct consequence of the properties of the Renyi divergences" [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023]. This connection is used to demonstrate that the `h_α` functions are monotonically increasing in α, which allows the parameter α to be used as a "sensitivity" tuner for the anomaly detector [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

According to the provided text, applying a non-uniformly-random choice of variables and/or thresholds can make "clustered" diverse outliers—which are often a more interesting and harder to identify class of outlier—more easily identifiable [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

The paper states that for clustered outliers from multimodal datasets, non-uniformly-random splits provide an advantage, and these types of outliers are better identified by tree-based models than by other model families [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021]. The authors' proposed splitting rule, a non-uniform method, was found to offer "increased performance for the outliers of utmost interest (clustered outliers from multi-modal datasets)" [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021]. However, this improvement comes at the cost of "degraded performance in other classes of outliers" [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

Based on the provided context, the Kernel Isolation Forest (KIFD) method is designed to analyze hyperspectral images (HSIs) for the purpose of anomaly detection [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

Hyperspectral remotely sensed images contain hundreds or thousands of spectral bands, and the goal of this analysis is to identify targets that are spatially or spectrally different from their surrounding background without prior knowledge of the target's signature [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019]. This type of analysis has applications in areas such as military defense, search-and-rescue, mine detection, and environmental monitoring [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

The paper evaluates the KIFD method on several real hyperspectral datasets captured by sensors like the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and the Hyperspectral Digital Imagery Collection Experiment (HYDICE). The specific scenes analyzed include:
*   An airport in San Diego, CA [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].
*   An urban area with cars and roofs [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the main advantage of Generalized Isolation Forest (GIF) over Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) is its faster computation time [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

This speed improvement is achieved by addressing a key inefficiency in the EIF algorithm. EIF's method of selecting a separation hyperplane can lead to the creation of "empty branches," where a random cut fails to separate any data points [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. These empty branches increase the complexity of the trees and result in "additional computational overhead" [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. The probability of generating an empty branch in EIF increases with the number of dimensions [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

GIF overcomes this issue by modifying the splitting process. Instead of sampling a hyperplane within a hypercube that encloses the data, GIF selects a hyperplane that is guaranteed to pass through the convex hull of the data [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. This strategy ensures that the data is always partitioned into two non-empty subsets, thereby eliminating empty branches [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

Experiments confirm this advantage, showing that the time required to create the forests is "significantly smaller for GIF compared to EIF" [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. However, one source notes that this speed advantage can be dependent on the specific software implementation; while an initial comparison showed GIF to be an order of magnitude faster than the author-provided EIF, a re-implemented EIF with a focus on speed was found to be faster than GIF [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].
