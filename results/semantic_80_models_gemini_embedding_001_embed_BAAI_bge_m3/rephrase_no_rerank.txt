Response:
Based on the provided context, the standard Isolation Forest algorithm produces artifacts in anomaly score heat maps due to its method of creating branch cuts. The specific artifact is the appearance of rectangular, axis-parallel bands of lower anomaly scores [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

This issue arises because the standard algorithm's branching operations are restricted to creating cuts that are always parallel to the coordinate axes (i.e., horizontal or vertical) [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This introduces a bias in the anomaly score map [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

The visual manifestations of this artifact depend on the data distribution:
*   **For a single cluster of data:** The artifact appears as rectangular bands extending horizontally and vertically from the data's center, creating a cross-like shape. This prevents the anomaly score map from being circular and symmetric as expected for normally distributed data [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].
*   **For two distinct clusters:** The artifact appears as rectangular bands aligned with each cluster's center. At the intersection of these bands, the artifact is amplified and creates "ghost" clusters—regions of unexpectedly low anomaly scores where no data exists [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].
*   **For structured data (e.g., sinusoidal):** The algorithm fails to capture the underlying structure and instead treats the data as a large rectangular blob, again with horizontal and vertical bands emanating from it [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

These artifacts are problematic because they can cause an anomalous data point to be incorrectly categorized as nominal if it happens to fall within these bands or "ghost" regions. This reduces the algorithm's reliability and wrongly suggests non-existent structures in the data [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) aims to fix this by allowing the data to be sliced using hyperplanes with random slopes, rather than being restricted to axis-parallel cuts. This approach successfully removes the bands and "ghost" regions from the score maps [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Response:
The standard Isolation Forest algorithm suffers from a bias caused by its branching procedure [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. The algorithm creates splits by slicing data along random values of randomly selected features, which means the branching cuts are always hyperplanes parallel to the coordinate axes (e.g., horizontal or vertical lines in 2D) [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. This "axis-parallel" bias introduces artifacts into the anomaly score maps, creating artificial rectangular zones or bands of inconsistent scores that are not present in the original data [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) fixes this issue by generalizing the splitting condition [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. Instead of being restricted to axis-parallel cuts, EIF allows the branching hyperplanes to have random slopes [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. At each branching point, the algorithm selects a random slope and a random intercept to define the cut, rather than a random feature and value [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This extension completely resolves the bias introduced by the standard algorithm by truly randomizing the branching process [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. As a result, EIF remedies the artifacts seen in the anomaly score heat maps, leading to more robust and reliable anomaly scores [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Response:
The Functional Isolation Forest (FIF) algorithm projects functional data onto elements of a dictionary to create features, which are then used as "Split variables" for building the isolation trees [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019]. This projection of a function `x` onto a chosen dictionary element `d` is defined by their scalar product, `(x, d)_H` [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

The flexibility of FIF comes from the combined choice of the dictionary and the scalar product, which allows it to detect a wide variety of anomalies [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019]. Different scalar products can be used to measure different types of anomalies; for instance, the L₂ scalar product helps detect "location anomalies," while the L₂ scalar product of derivatives is suited for "shape anomalies" [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019]. These can also be combined to account for both location and shape anomalies simultaneously [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

The algorithm can be extended to multivariate functional data. In this case, the projection uses a coordinate-wise sum of the scalar products for each of the `d` dimensions, defined by the formula: `(f, g)_{H^{⊗d}} := ∑_{i=1}^d ⟨f⁽ⁱ⁾, g⁽ⁱ⁾⟩_H` [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the Generalized Isolation Forest (GIF) improves upon the Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) by changing the method for selecting the separation hyperplane to eliminate the creation of empty branches [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

The problem in EIF is that its splitting strategy can generate empty branches, which is inefficient and increases the complexity of the trees [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. This occurs because EIF selects an intercept point for its random hyperplane from within the smallest axis-bounding hypercube that encloses the data. This sampling area can include regions outside the convex hull of the data points, and if an intercept is sampled there, it can result in a partition where one branch contains no data points [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. This issue is a significant limitation of EIF, as the probability of generating empty branches rises with tree depth, incurring additional computational overhead [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

GIF solves this by ensuring the separation hyperplane always partitions the data into two non-empty subsets [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. Instead of sampling an intercept from a hypercube, GIF's procedure is as follows:
1.  A random normal unit vector `w` is selected [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
2.  All data points in the current node are projected onto this vector [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].
3.  The minimum (`p_min`) and maximum (`p_max`) values of these projections are identified [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
4.  A split value `p` is then sampled uniformly only within the interval between these minimum and maximum values (`p ~ U([p_min; p_max])`) [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

This strategy guarantees that there is at least one data point in each of the two resulting branches, as the split is made between the extreme points of the data along that projection [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. This is equivalent to reducing the sampling volume from EIF's hypercube to the convex hull of the data, which means the probability of creating an empty branch is zero for GIF [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. By generating trees without any empty branches, GIF significantly improves execution times compared to EIF [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the K-Means Isolation Forest (K-Means IF) algorithm combines its partitioning strategy with the K-Means clustering algorithm in the following way:

Unlike a Standard Isolation Forest which creates binary splits, the K-Means IF creates a multi-branch tree structure that adapts to the local density of the data [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].

The process for partitioning the data at each node in a tree is as follows:
1.  A single component (or feature) is randomly selected [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
2.  All data points in the current node are projected onto this selected component [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
3.  The K-Means clustering algorithm is then applied to these projected one-dimensional data points to determine the partition boundaries [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
4.  The optimal number of clusters, `k`, is determined using the "elbow-rule" [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].
5.  This process results in the node having `k` child nodes, one for each identified cluster. Each data point is assigned to the child node corresponding to the cluster it most likely belongs to, based on the Euclidean distance to the nearest cluster centroid [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

This hybrid approach represents a combination of isolation and density-based anomaly detection methods [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. The anomaly score can then be quantified using the point's membership value to its assigned cluster [K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the Probabilistic Generalization of Isolation Forest (PGIF) uses segment-cumulated probability to enhance the way data splits are performed when building isolation trees [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

The core idea is to move away from the original Isolation Forest's method of using a uniform distribution to generate split points. In the original algorithm, the probability of a split occurring in any given segment depends only on the length of that segment, which means splits are more likely to happen across wide, dense clusters rather than in the narrower gaps between them [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

PGIF introduces a "nonlinear dependence of segment-cumulated probability from the length of segment" to make the splitting process more effective [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. It achieves this through the following steps:

1.  **Assigning Probabilities:** PGIF builds an empirical probability density distribution from the training data. It assigns a lower probability density to densely populated regions (clusters) and a higher probability density to the sparsely populated regions or gaps between clusters [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. The probability density value on these segments is proportional to their lengths [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

2.  **Generating Splits:** An algorithm then uses the "cumulated probability" assigned to each segment to select a split point. A random number is generated and compared against the cumulated probability of segments in a loop to determine where the split will occur [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

By assigning a higher probability density to the gaps between clusters, PGIF makes it more likely that splits will occur in these empty regions. This allows the model to isolate outliers, which are often separated from clusters by such gaps, earlier in the tree-building process, resulting in higher and more accurate anomaly scores [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

Evaluation Status: ANSWERABLE

Response:
Based on the provided context, the Rényi divergence relates to the aggregation functions in distribution-based scoring for Isolation Forests through an intermediate function, `f_α` [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023]. This relationship provides an "information-theoretically motivated generalisation" of the score aggregation function used in the standard Isolation Forest algorithm [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

The connection is established through the following steps:

1.  A family of functions, `f_α`, is linked to the α-Rényi divergence (`R_α`) via the identity: `f_α(x) = exp(-R_α(x/||x||_1 || 1/n))`, where **1** is the vector of ones [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].
2.  The aggregation functions, `h_α`, are then defined in terms of these `f_α` functions as: `h_α(x) = 2^(−f_α(x))` [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

The properties of the `f_α` functions, and consequently the aggregation functions `h_α`, are a direct result of the properties of the Rényi divergences. This connection is used to show that the `h_α` functions are monotonically increasing in the parameter `α` and that they interpolate between the standard Isolation Forest aggregation function (when `α = 0`) and the maximum function (when `α = ∞`) [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

Response:
According to the "Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests" paper, applying a non-uniformly-random choice of variables and/or split thresholds can make "clustered" diverse outliers more easily identifiable [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

The paper states that while the original Isolation Forest (IFOREST) performs well on datasets with clustered outliers, non-uniformly-random splits provide an "edge" in identifying them. These types of outliers, which are often found in multi-modal datasets, are considered among the "hardest to flag" but are also frequently of the "utmost interest" [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

The paper proposes and analyzes different guiding heuristics for split selection. One such method, the "Fair-Cut Forest" or FCF, was found to offer "increased performance" for clustered outliers in multi-modal datasets. In these specific cases, FCF was identified as the "best performer" [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021]. The splitting criterion used by FCF is described as especially useful in "clustered or multimodal distributions" [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

However, this improvement comes with a trade-off. The paper notes that these specialized heuristics result in "degraded performance in other classes of outliers" and "hindered performance in datasets in which non-tree-based methods outperform IFOREST" [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021]. This suggests that there is no single best approach and that different methods should be used for different types of outliers [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the Kernel Isolation Forest (KIFD) method is designed for anomaly detection in hyperspectral images (HSIs) within the domain of remote sensing [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

Hyperspectral images are described as remotely sensed images that contain hundreds of spectral bands, which makes them a powerful tool for applications like military defense, search-and-rescue, mine detection, and environmental monitoring [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019]. The goal is to distinguish targets that are spectrally or spatially different from their surrounding background without any prior knowledge of their signatures [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

The paper evaluates the method on several real-world hyperspectral data sets, including:
*   An Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) image of the San Diego airport, where the anomalies to be detected are three airplanes [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].
*   A Hyperspectral Digital Imagery Collection Experiment (HYDICE) data set of an urban area, where man-made objects like cars and roofs are considered anomalies [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the 'visual elbow rule' is used to define a threshold for anomaly detection [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019]. This is done by creating a scatter plot of sorted anomaly scores, which shows a clear "elbow" or bend in the curve. This elbow point visually separates the high-scoring anomalies from the low-scoring normal data, and a threshold is set at this location [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

While a similar heuristic called the "elbow-rule" is also mentioned for determining the optimal number of clusters in K-Means algorithms, its specific use in the Functional Isolation Forest experiments is for setting the anomaly score threshold [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].

Response:
The main advantage of Generalized Isolation Forest (GIF) over Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) is its faster computation time, which is achieved by eliminating the creation of empty branches during the tree-building process [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

A significant limitation of EIF is that its strategy for selecting a random hyperplane can result in branches that contain no data points, which is a common inefficiency that incurs "additional computational overhead" [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. GIF was introduced to address this specific issue [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. The fundamental difference is that GIF selects a separation hyperplane that is guaranteed to pass through the convex hull of the data, which ensures the data is always partitioned into two non-empty subsets [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. The primary benefit of this method is the "improved computational performance derived from the elimination of empty branches" [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

Experiments have demonstrated that the time required to create the forests is "significantly smaller for GIF compared to EIF" [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. However, another study noted that the relative speed can be highly dependent on the specific software implementation. While an efficient implementation of GIF was reported to be an order of magnitude faster than the original EIF, a separate re-implementation of EIF that focused on speed was found to be an order of magnitude faster than GIF [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].
