Response:
Based on the provided context, the standard Isolation Forest produces several artifacts in anomaly score heat maps due to its branching procedure, which is restricted to making cuts parallel to the coordinate axes [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. The Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) aims to fix these specific issues by allowing branching hyperplanes to have random slopes [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

The specific artifacts are:

*   **Rectangular Bands and Stripes:** For a single, circular cluster of data, the standard algorithm produces "rectangular regions of lower anomaly score in the x and y directions" instead of the expected circular pattern [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This creates artificial bands or stripes, sometimes resembling a cross, which are not present in the original data distribution [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This leads to inconsistent scores where two points at the same radial distance from the center can be scored differently [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

*   **"Ghost" Clusters:** In datasets with multiple clusters, the rectangular bands extending from each data cluster can intersect. At these intersections, the algorithm creates areas of artificially low anomaly scores known as "'ghost' clusters" [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This wrongly indicates a non-existent structure in the data and can cause a truly anomalous data point that falls within a "ghost" region to be miscategorized as nominal [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

*   **High Score Variance:** The standard Isolation Forest produces anomaly scores with high variance, particularly in regions of high anomaly. This means the scores can vary largely depending on a point's alignment with the axes rather than its true anomalous nature, reducing the algorithm's robustness and reliability [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. EIF resolves this, resulting in "remarkably smaller variances" [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Response:
The standard Isolation Forest algorithm suffers from an "axis-parallel" bias because its method for splitting data, known as branching, is restricted to cuts that are parallel to the coordinate axes (e.g., horizontal or vertical) [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. This bias introduces artifacts into the anomaly score maps, creating artificial rectangular regions or striped "ghost regions" of inconsistent scores that do not exist in the original data distribution [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. As a result, the standard algorithm struggles to capture correlations between features and can perform poorly on complex data distributions [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) fixes this bias by generalizing the branching procedure [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. Instead of being restricted to axis-parallel cuts, EIF allows the branching hyperplanes to have random slopes, enabling them to take on any orientation [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This is accomplished by selecting two pieces of information for each branch cut:
1.  A random slope, which is determined by choosing a normal vector uniformly over the unit N-Sphere [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].
2.  A random intercept, chosen from the range of available data values [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

By using hyperplanes with random slopes, EIF "completely resolves the bias" present in the standard algorithm [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This approach remedies the artifacts in score maps and allows the algorithm to capture more complex data dependencies [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. The result is a more robust measurement with significantly smaller variance in anomaly scores, especially in regions of high anomaly likelihood [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Response:
Based on the provided context, Functional Isolation Forest (FIF) projects data by using a scalar product to project the functional data onto a chosen element from a dictionary [Staerman, 2019]. This process is a key component in the construction of a Functional Isolation Tree (F-itree) [Staerman, 2019].

The projection mechanism for multivariate functional data is defined as the coordinate-wise sum of the corresponding scalar products: `(f, g)_{H^{⊗d}} := ∑_{i=1}^d ⟨f⁽ⁱ⁾, g⁽ⁱ⁾⟩_H` [Staerman, 2019].

The choice of both the dictionary and the scalar product provides flexibility and allows the method to detect different types of anomalies [Staerman, 2019]:

*   **Dictionary**: The dictionary is a set of functions that serves as the candidate directions for projection. This can include various types of functions, such as wavelets, cosine packets, Brownian motion, or even the dataset itself (self-data dictionary) [Staerman, 2019]. The dictionary elements are referred to as *Split variables* [Staerman, 2019].
*   **Scalar Product**: The scalar product defines how the projection is measured and influences what kind of anomalies are detected. For example, an L2 scalar product is suited for detecting "location anomalies," while an L2 scalar product of the derivatives is used to detect anomalies related to "shape" [Staerman, 2019]. It is also possible to use a combination of these, such as the Sobolev W_{1,2} scalar product, to detect a wide variety of anomalies simultaneously [Staerman, 2019].

In summary, the combined selection of a dictionary element and a specific scalar product for the projection gives the FIF algorithm great flexibility in identifying diverse types of anomalies in functional data [Staerman, 2019].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the Kernel Isolation Forest method operates on the assumption that anomalies are more susceptible to isolation than background data in the kernel space. The reasoning for this is as follows:

The standard Isolation Forest (iForest) algorithm is based on the principle that anomalies are "rare and different from those of normal instances," which makes them more susceptible to isolation in binary tree structures [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019]. Anomalous instances require fewer partitions to be isolated and thus have shorter average path lengths in the trees [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

Kernel methods are employed to enhance this effect. A kernel method projects the original data into a higher-dimensional feature space. The purpose of this projection is to increase the separability between classes that may not be linearly separable in the original space [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019]. By using a kernel method, the goal is to "better separate the anomaly and background" [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

Therefore, the assumption is that by mapping the data to a higher-dimensional kernel space where the anomaly and background classes are more distinctly separated, the inherent susceptibility of anomalies to isolation by the iForest algorithm is increased [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

Response:
Based on the context provided, Generalized Isolation Forest (GIF) improves upon Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) by implementing a sampling strategy that prevents the creation of empty branches in its trees, which is a known drawback of the EIF algorithm [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

The issue with EIF is that its method of sampling a random slope and intercept for its hyperplanes can result in a split where all data points fall on one side of the hyperplane. When this occurs, the corresponding branch on the other side of the split is left empty, which can lead to a loss of information [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. These empty branches in EIF occur when intercepts are sampled outside the convex hull of the data points but inside the axis-bounding hypercube. The probability of this happening increases with the number of dimensions [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

GIF overcomes this problem by changing how the split value is determined. Instead of sampling an intercept from the entire range, GIF projects all data points onto a sampled normal unit vector. It then identifies the minimum and maximum values among these projections and samples a split value uniformly only between these two extreme values. This approach guarantees that there will be at least one data point in each of the two resulting branches, thereby ensuring that no branches are empty. For GIF, the probability of sampling a split that creates an empty branch is zero [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

Response:
The K-Means Isolation Forest (K-Means IF) algorithm combines a partitioning strategy with K-Means clustering to create a density-aware, multi-branch tree structure, departing from the strictly binary trees used in the Standard Isolation Forest [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].

The partitioning process at each node of a tree is as follows:
1.  A single component (dimension) is randomly selected [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
2.  All data points in the current node are projected onto this selected component [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
3.  The K-Means clustering algorithm is applied to the projected one-dimensional data to find partition boundaries [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
4.  The optimal number of clusters, denoted as `k`, is determined using the "elbow-rule" [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

This strategy results in a node having `k` child nodes, one for each identified cluster, allowing the tree structure to adapt to the local density of the data [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. Each data point is then assigned to the cluster to which it most likely belongs based on its distance to that cluster's centroid [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. This approach allows the algorithm to build a search tree with multiple branches at each node, in contrast to the two-branch limit in the original Isolation Forest method [K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020]. The anomaly score is then quantified using the membership value to the assigned cluster [K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the Probabilistic Generalization of Isolation Forest (PGIF) is founded on the "nonlinear dependence of segment-cumulated probability from the length of segment" [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

The algorithm works by assigning different probabilities to various regions of the explored space. It does this by building an empirical distribution of probability density from the training data. This generalization allows PGIF to achieve more effective splits that are performed between dense clusters of data points, rather than through them. As a result, the model assigns higher anomaly scores to these "intra-cluster gaps," making it more effective at detecting anomalies hidden between clusters [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the family of aggregation functions, `f_α`, is linked to the α-Rényi divergence (`R_α`) from information theory through the identity:

`f_α(x) = exp(-R_α(\frac{x}{||x||_1} || \frac{1}{n}))`

where **1** is the vector of ones [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

This connection is used to demonstrate key properties of the aggregation functions. The functions `f_α` are part of a family of aggregation functions introduced to allow users to "tune" the sensitivity of the aggregation step to estimators with below-average anomaly scores [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

These functions are then used to create the final aggregation functions, `h_α`, through the mapping `h_α(x) = 2^{−f_α(x)}`. The link to Rényi divergences is used to prove that the properties of `f_α` are a direct consequence of the properties of the Rényi divergences. This, in turn, is used to show that the final aggregation functions, `h_α`, satisfy the following properties [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023]:
1.  `h_0 = h_{IF}` (The function for α=0 is the standard Isolation Forest aggregation function).
2.  `h_∞(x) = max(x)` (The function for α=∞ is the maximum of the scores).
3.  `α > α′ ⇒ h_α(x) ≥ f_α′(x)` for all `x ∈ R^n_{≥0}`, `α ≥ 0`.

This means the `h_α` functions are monotonically increasing in `α` and interpolate between the standard Isolation Forest aggregation and the maximum function [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

Response:
According to the paper, applying a non-uniformly-random choice of variables and/or split thresholds can make it easier to identify "clustered" diverse outliers, which are often a more interesting but harder-to-flag class of outliers [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

The paper's experiments show that on datasets with clustered outliers from multimodal distributions (such as "Satellite" and "Annthyroid"), non-uniformly-random splits provide an "edge" in detection performance. For example, the proposed Fair-Cut Forest (FCF) algorithm, which uses a non-uniform deterministic split threshold, was found to offer increased performance for these specific outlier types. However, this improvement comes at the expense of degraded performance in detecting other classes of outliers [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

Based on the provided context, the Kernel Isolation Forest method is designed to analyze **hyperspectral images (HSIs)** for the purpose of **anomaly detection** [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

Hyperspectral remotely sensed images contain hundreds or thousands of spectral bands, and the goal of anomaly detection is to identify targets that are spatially or spectrally very different from their surrounding background without any prior knowledge of the target or background [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

The specific image types evaluated in the study include:
*   An Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) image of the San Diego airport, where airplanes are the anomalies [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].
*   A Hyperspectral Digital Imagery Collection Experiment (HYDICE) image of an urban area, where man-made objects like cars and roofs are considered anomalies [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].
*   An image of an oil refinery, where constructions such as storage tanks and towers are the anomaly targets [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].
*   An AVIRIS image of Grand Isle, Louisiana, where man-made objects in the water are the anomalies to be detected [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].
