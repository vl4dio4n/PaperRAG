Response:
Based on the provided context, the standard Isolation Forest produces artifacts in anomaly score heat maps that manifest as distinct horizontal and vertical bands [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. These bands are artificial zones of inconsistent, higher or lower anomaly scores that are not representative of the actual data distribution [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

This issue arises because the branching procedure in the standard algorithm slices data using only horizontal and vertical cuts, which are parallel to the coordinate axes. This introduces a bias in the anomaly scores [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

The specific appearance of the artifact depends on the data's structure:
*   **For a single, circular cluster of data:** The heat map should be circular, but the standard Isolation Forest produces "rectangular regions of lower anomaly score in the x and y directions," creating an artifact that resembles a cross [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].
*   **For multiple data clusters:** Rectangular bands align with the cluster centers. At the intersection of these bands, the artifact is amplified, creating the appearance of "ghost" clusters in areas where no data exists [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].
*   **For data with inherent structures (e.g., a sine curve):** The algorithm can fail to detect the structure and instead treats the data as a "large rectangular blob with horizontal and vertical bands" [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

These artifacts can reduce the reliability of the algorithm, as data points of similar importance could be categorized differently depending on their location relative to these bands [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) aims to fix this problem by allowing the data to be sliced using hyperplanes with random slopes, which completely resolves the bias and removes the artifacts [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) fixes the bias issues of the standard Isolation Forest algorithm by changing the method used for splitting data within its decision trees [Hariri et al., 2021; Vlad Birsan, 2025].

The standard Isolation Forest algorithm suffers from an "axis-parallel" bias because it splits data by randomly selecting a single feature and a split value, creating splits that are parallel to the coordinate axes [Vlad Birsan, 2025; Lesouple et al., 2021; Cortes et al., 2021]. This method introduces artifacts into the anomaly score maps, such as rectangular "ghost regions" and line patterns where anomaly scores are artificially low, which do not reflect the actual data distribution [Hariri et al., 2021; Vlad Birsan, 2025]. This bias means the standard algorithm struggles to capture correlations between features [Vlad Birsan, 2025].

To resolve this, the Extended Isolation Forest modifies the splitting mechanism to use hyperplanes with random slopes, which are not restricted to being parallel to the coordinate axes [Hariri et al., 2021]. Instead of selecting one feature to split on, EIF determines a split by randomly selecting a normal vector and an intercept point [Hariri et al., 2021]. This creates oblique (non-axis-parallel) hyperplanes that can take on any orientation, allowing the algorithm to capture more complex data dependencies [Hariri et al., 2021; Vlad Birsan, 2025].

This extension completely resolves the bias introduced by the standard method, resulting in score maps that are free of the previously observed artifacts [Hariri et al., 2021]. EIF produces remarkably smaller variances in anomaly scores for points that should be similar, leading to improved robustness and consistently better performance on benchmark datasets [Hariri et al., 2021].

Evaluation Status: ANSWERABLE
Generating answer...
Response:
The Functional Isolation Forest (FIF) algorithm operates in a functional Hilbert space, and its flexibility in detecting a wide variety of anomalies stems from its method of projecting data, which involves the combined choice of a dictionary and a scalar product [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

The projection is performed by applying a scalar product between the functional data and a chosen element from a dictionary. For multivariate functional data, this is done using the coordinate-wise sum of the corresponding scalar products to project the data onto a selected dictionary element [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

**Scalar Products:**
The choice of scalar product allows the algorithm to focus on different types of anomalies. For instance, to account for both location and shape anomalies simultaneously, the following scalar product can be used:

`(f, g) := α × (f,g)_(L_2) / (||f|| ||g||) + (1 − α) × (f', g')_(L_2) / (||f'|| ||g'||), α ∈ [0, 1]`

Different values of the parameter `α` yield different standard scalar products:
*   **α = 1**: The classical L₂ scalar product, which is more sensitive to location anomalies.
*   **α = 0**: The L₂ scalar product of the derivative, which is more sensitive to shape or slope anomalies.
*   **α = 0.5**: The Sobolev W_{1,2} scalar product, which provides a compromise between the two [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

A wide variety of other L₂-scalar products related to derivatives can also be used [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

**Dictionaries:**
The dictionary provides the elements onto which the data is projected. The choice of dictionary can impact the detection of specific functional anomalies. The context provides several examples of dictionaries that can be used:
*   Random dictionaries like uniform indicator (UI) or Brownian motion (B) [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].
*   Other dictionaries such as dyadic indicator (DI), cosines (Cos), and Mexican hat wavelet (MHW) [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].
*   A "self-data dictionary" (Self), which uses the observations themselves or their transforms as the dictionary elements [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

Evaluation Status: ANSWERABLE
Generating answer...
Response:
Based on the provided context, anomalies are assumed to be more susceptible to isolation in the kernel space for the following reasons:

The fundamental principle of the Isolation Forest (iForest) algorithm is that anomaly instances are "rare and different" from normal instances, which makes them more susceptible to isolation within a binary tree structure [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019]. In the context of hyperspectral images, anomalies typically have different spectral values compared to the background, which makes them easier to isolate [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

The kernel method is introduced to enhance this process. The purpose of using a kernel method is to project the original input data into a higher-dimensional feature space in order to "better separate the anomaly and background" [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019]. This mapping is particularly useful if the classes (anomalies and background) are not linearly separable in the original data space. By moving to a higher-dimensional space, the hope is that the classes will become linearly separable, thereby increasing the "computational capability" of the detection algorithm [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

Therefore, the Kernel Isolation Forest method is based on the assumption that by mapping the hyperspectral data into this kernel feature space, the isolation property of anomalies is better captured, making them even more susceptible to being isolated and detected [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

Response:
Based on the provided context, Generalized Isolation Forest (GIF) improves upon Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) by changing the splitting process to completely eliminate the creation of empty branches [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

The strategy in EIF of using random hyperplanes can lead to "empty branches," where a cut separates no data, which is an inefficiency that increases the complexity and execution time of the trees in the forest [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

GIF avoids this problem with a refined method:
1.  All data points at a node are projected onto a randomly sampled normal unit vector [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
2.  The minimum and maximum values of these projections are identified [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
3.  A split value is then sampled uniformly *between* these minimum and maximum values [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

This sampling process ensures that the split partitions the data into two non-empty subsets, guaranteeing that there is at least one data point in each branch [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. The primary benefit of producing trees without any empty branches is a significant improvement in computational performance and execution time when compared to EIF [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

Response:
The K-Means Isolation Forest (K-Means IF) algorithm integrates K-Means clustering into its partitioning strategy by altering how separation hyperplanes are selected compared to the standard Isolation Forest [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. Instead of a purely random binary split, this hybrid approach departs from the classic binary search tree structure to one with multiple branches based on data clusters [K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020; K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].

The process for creating a node in the tree is as follows:
1.  A single component (dimension) is randomly selected from the dataset [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
2.  All data points in the current node are projected onto this chosen component, creating a 1-dimensional representation of the data [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
3.  The K-Means clustering algorithm is applied to this 1D data to determine partition boundaries. The optimal number of clusters, `k`, is determined using the "elbow-rule" heuristic [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
4.  Each point is then assigned to the cluster it most likely belongs to based on its distance to the cluster's centroid [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

This method results in a tree structure where a node can have `k` child nodes, one for each cluster identified, as opposed to the two branches in the original method [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020]. Because the clusters are formed in a 1-dimensional space, the assignment boundaries are hyperplanes perpendicular to the randomly chosen component [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. This allows the method to better "fit the data at the step of decision tree building" [K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].

Response:
The Probabilistic Generalization of Isolation Forest (PGIF) uses the concept of segment-cumulated probability to modify how splitting points are chosen when building the isolation trees [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. Unlike the original Isolation Forest, which uses a uniform distribution to generate split points, PGIF aims to make splits in a more "meaningful way" [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

The core idea is based on the assumption that a split through a gap between clusters is more effective at isolating outliers than a split through a dense cluster [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. To achieve this, PGIF implements the following:

1.  **Empirical Probability Distribution**: It builds an empirical, piecewise probability density function on the segments between neighboring points in the training data [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].
2.  **Nonlinear Dependence on Segment Length**: The key generalization is creating a nonlinear relationship where the probability cumulated on a given segment is proportional to its length raised to the k-th power [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].
3.  **Biased Splitting**: This mechanism assigns a lower probability density to densely populated regions (clusters) and a higher probability density to the less populated, out-of-cluster spaces. This increases the likelihood that splits will occur in the gaps between clusters, which helps to isolate anomalies more effectively and with shorter paths in the tree [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the aggregation functions `h_α` are linked to the Rényi divergence through a set of functions denoted as `f_α` [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023]. The paper introduces a family of aggregation functions defined as `h_α(x) = 2^(−f_α(x))` [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

The connection to information theory is established through a "simple identity" that links `f_α(x)` to the α-Rényi divergence, `R_α`:

`f_α(x) = exp(-R_α(x/||x||_1 || 1/n))`

In this equation, `R_α` is the α-Rényi divergence, and **1** represents the vector of ones [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023]. The α-Rényi divergence itself is defined for `p, q ∈ R^d_{≥0}` and `α ∈ (0, 1) ∪ (1,∞)` as:

`R_α(p||q) = (1/(α-1)) * ln(Σ(p_i^α * q_i^(1-α)))`

The paper notes that the properties of the `f_α` functions are a "direct consequence" of the properties of the Rényi divergences [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

Response:
According to the provided text, applying a non-uniformly-random choice of variables and/or split thresholds can make it easier to identify "clustered" outliers compared to the original Isolation Forest (iForest) algorithm, which uses a uniformly random approach [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

Key points on how non-uniform splitting affects the detection of clustered outliers are:

*   **Improved Detection:** Certain non-uniform split guiding criteria can result in "significantly better outlier discrimination for certain classes of outliers," particularly for "clustered" diverse outliers [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].
*   **Focus on Harder Cases:** The paper identifies the hardest classes of outliers as those in multi-modal distributions where outliers are "clustered" around different minority modes, such as in the "Satellite" dataset. Methods like iForest tend to outperform other algorithms on these cases, and non-uniform heuristics can further enhance this capability [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].
*   **Proposed Heuristic:** The paper proposes a splitting rule that uses a deterministic split threshold selection by maximizing a "pooled information gain metric." This non-uniform approach was found to offer increased performance for clustered outliers from multi-modal datasets [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].
*   **Trade-Offs:** This improved performance on clustered outliers comes at a cost. The paper emphasizes that there is a trade-off, and using non-uniform heuristics for clustered outliers leads to "degraded performance in other classes of outliers." It suggests that a single universal outlier detector might not be the best approach, as different methods are better suited for different types of anomalies [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].
*   **Context on Clustered Outliers:** "Clustered" outliers are considered more "interesting" because they typically originate from a repeated process, like fraudulent activity, as opposed to "scattered" outliers from unrelated events. They are also considered harder to identify [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

The main advantage of Generalized Isolation Forest (GIF) over Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) is its significantly faster computation time [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

This speed improvement is achieved because the GIF algorithm is designed to generate trees without any "empty branches," which is a common inefficiency in EIF [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

GIF avoids this issue by selecting a separation hyperplane that is guaranteed to partition the data points into two non-empty subsets.
