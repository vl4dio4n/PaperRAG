Response:
Based on the provided context, the standard Isolation Forest (IF) produces several specific artifacts in anomaly score heat maps that the Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) is designed to fix:

*   **Axis-Parallel Artifacts:** The most prominent artifact is the appearance of "distinct horizontal and vertical bands" or "line patterns parallel to the coordinate axes" in the anomaly score maps [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. For a single cluster of data, these bands create an artifact that resembles a cross [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. These bands indicate inconsistent anomaly scores; for instance, along directions parallel to the axes, the anomaly score can remain incorrectly low, while it increases correctly in diagonal directions [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

*   **"Ghost" Artifacts or Clusters:** The algorithm can generate "ghost artifacts," which are regions assigned a low anomaly score even though they contain little to no data [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. In datasets with multiple clusters, the intersection of the horizontal and vertical bands can create "ghost clusters," which are artifactual spots of high anomaly scores in areas where no data exists [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

*   **Poor Structure Representation:** For data with a more complex structure, such as a sinusoidal shape, the standard Isolation Forest performs poorly. It may treat the data as a simple "large rectangular blob" and produce the same horizontal and vertical bands parallel to the coordinate axes, failing to capture the underlying data structure [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

These artifacts are caused by the standard algorithm's branching procedure, which slices data using "orthogonal hyperplanes parallel to the system's axes" [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This introduces a bias that results in "artificial zones of higher/lower scores" that are not present in the original data [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

The Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) resolves these issues by allowing the hyperplanes used for splitting the data to have random slopes instead of being strictly parallel to the coordinate axes [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This removes the artifacts, resulting in a score map that is a more representative and robust measurement of the data's structure [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Response:
The standard Isolation Forest algorithm suffers from a bias because its branching process relies on selecting a random dimension and then splitting the data with a value parallel to the coordinate axes [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. This "axis-parallel" splitting method creates a bias dependent on the data's location relative to the coordinate frame, which can produce inconsistent anomaly scores and artificial zones of higher or lower scores not present in the original data [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. These artifacts can appear as "ghost" clusters or horizontal and vertical bands in score maps, causing the algorithm to perform poorly on data with more complex structures [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

The Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) fixes these bias issues by changing the branching mechanism. Instead of using splits that are only parallel to the coordinate frame, EIF uses hyperplanes with random slopes, which are non-axis-parallel, for splitting the data [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021]. This generalization of the splitting condition allows the algorithm to capture more complex dependencies between features [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

This modification "completely resolves the bias introduced in the case of standard Isolation Forest" [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. The authors note two approaches to fix the bias: rotating the data before building each tree and the EIF method. The rotation method improves score robustness by averaging out the bias from many trees, but it is considered less desirable because the underlying "rectangular bias" in each tree still exists, and the method can be cumbersome to apply [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. EIF is presented as the preferred approach [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

By using random-slope hyperplanes, EIF remedies the artifacts seen in anomaly score maps and produces remarkably smaller variances in scores compared to the standard algorithm. EIF consistently performed better than the standard Isolation Forest across various real-world benchmark datasets, showing improved AUC for both ROC and PRC metrics [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Response:
The Functional Isolation Forest (FIF) algorithm's flexibility in detecting different types of anomalies is enabled by the combined choice of a dictionary and a scalar product used for projection [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

For univariate functional data, a scalar product is chosen to measure different types of anomalies. For example, the L₂ scalar product is used to detect "location anomalies," while the L₂ scalar product of derivatives can detect anomalies related to "shape." To account for both location and shape simultaneously, the following scalar product can be used [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019]:
`(f, g) := α × (f,g)_{L_2} / (||f|| ||g||) + (1 − α) × (f', g')_{L_2} / (||f'|| ||g'||), α ∈ [0, 1]`
Here, `α = 1` corresponds to the classical L₂ scalar product, `α = 0` to the L₂ scalar product of derivatives, and `α = 0.5` is the Sobolev W_{1,2} scalar product [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

The algorithm also employs a dictionary, which can be composed of various functions. Examples of dictionaries used include *mexican hat wavelet*, *Brownian motion*, *cosine*, *dyadic indicator*, and the *self-data dictionary*, which contains the dataset itself [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

For multivariate functional data, FIF projects the data onto a chosen dictionary element by using a coordinate-wise sum of the corresponding scalar products for each of the `d` dimensions. This projection is defined as [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019]:
`(f, g)_{H^{⊗d}} := ∑_{i=1}^d ⟨f⁽ⁱ⁾, g⁽ⁱ⁾⟩_H` [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

Response:
The Generalized Isolation Forest (GIF) algorithm improves upon the Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) by refining the splitting process to eliminate the creation of "empty branches," which are a common inefficiency in EIF [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

The improvement is achieved through a specific modification to how the separation hyperplane is chosen:
*   **Problem in EIF**: In EIF, random hyperplanes are used to split the data. However, this strategy can generate empty branches, which occurs when the randomly sampled intercept for the hyperplane falls outside the convex hull of the data points [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. This is an inefficient process that increases the complexity and computational overhead of the trees [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. The probability of this occurring increases with the number of dimensions due to the curse of dimensionality [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

*   **GIF's Solution**: To prevent empty branches, GIF modifies the splitting method. It first projects all data points onto a randomly selected normal unit vector. Then, it identifies the minimum and maximum values among these projections and samples a split value uniformly only within this range [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

*   **Result**: This technique ensures that the separating hyperplane always passes through the convex hull of the data, which guarantees that the data is partitioned into two non-empty subsets [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. By generating trees without any empty branches, GIF achieves significantly faster execution times and improved computational performance compared to EIF, while maintaining similar anomaly detection accuracy [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

Response:
The K-Means Isolation Forest (K-Means IF) algorithm is a hybrid approach that combines isolation-based and density-based anomaly detection methods [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. Instead of the purely random, axis-parallel splits used in Standard Isolation Forest, K-Means IF employs a density-aware partitioning strategy that adapts to the local data distribution [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

The process of combining partitioning with K-Means clustering at each node of an isolation tree is as follows:

1.  **Random Component Selection**: The algorithm randomly selects a single component, or dimension, from the dataset [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
2.  **Data Projection**: All data points within the current node are projected onto this single selected component [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
3.  **K-Means Clustering**: The K-Means clustering algorithm is applied to the 1-dimensional projected data to identify clusters and determine the partition boundaries [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020]. The optimal number of clusters, 'k', is determined using the "elbow-rule" heuristic [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
4.  **Multi-Branch Tree Structure**: This process results in a tree structure that is not strictly binary. A node will have 'k' child nodes, where 'k' is the number of clusters identified by the K-Means algorithm [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020]. Data points are assigned to a child node based on the cluster they belong to, which is determined by their Euclidean distance to the nearest cluster centroid [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
5.  **Partition Boundaries**: Since the clustering is performed in a 1-dimensional space, the resulting assignment boundaries are hyperplanes perpendicular to the randomly chosen component [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

These two methods were introduced to extend the density-aware partitioning of K-Means IF and are designed to better capture complex, non-linear data distributions by integrating random projections with clustering [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the Probabilistic Generalization of Isolation Forest (PGIF) uses segment-cumulated probability to improve the way it splits data when building its isolation trees [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

The core idea is to move away from the original Isolation Forest's (IF) method of using a uniform distribution to select split points [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. In the original IF, the probability of a split occurring in any given segment depends only on the length of that segment. This means that splits are more likely to occur across wide, dense clusters of data points than across the narrower gaps between them [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

PGIF introduces a more meaningful way of splitting data by assigning different probabilities to different regions of the explored space. It operates on the assumption that a split through a gap separating clusters is more effective for isolating outliers [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. The algorithm implements this through the following steps:

1.  **Empirical Probability Distribution**: PGIF builds an empirical probability density distribution based on the training data. This is constructed as a "piecewise defined probability density function" [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].
2.  **Segments Between Points**: The function is defined over the separate segments that exist between neighboring points in the training dataset [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].
3.  **Nonlinear Probability Dependence**: The key generalization is the introduction of a "nonlinear dependence of segment-cumulated probability from the length of segment." Specifically, the probability cumulated on a given segment is made proportional to its length raised to the k-th power [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].
4.  **Targeted Splitting**: This method assigns a lower probability density to densely populated clusters and a higher probability density to the out-of-cluster regions where anomalies are expected to be. This makes the algorithm more likely to perform splits between clusters rather than through them, which is believed to isolate outliers more effectively [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

For its implementation, PGIF uses Kernel Density Estimation functions due to their useful analytical properties in defining the piecewise probability function [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. The cumulative probability function for generating a split value is calculated by summing the probabilities of preceding segments and integrating the probability density function over the final segment [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the family of aggregation functions, denoted as `h_α`, relates to the Rényi divergence through an intermediate function, `f_α` [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

The connection is established through two steps:

1.  The aggregation functions `h_α` are defined as `h_α(x) = 2^(−f_α(x))` [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].
2.  The function `f_α(x)` is directly linked to the α-Rényi divergence, `R_α`, through the identity:
    `f_α(x) = exp(-R_α(x/||x||_1 || 1/n))`
    where `x` is a vector of per-estimator scores and `1/n` represents the vector of ones [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

The Rényi divergences generalize the Kullback-Leibler divergence and have various uses in information theory. The properties of the `f_α` functions, and by extension the `h_α` aggregation functions, are a "direct consequence of the properties of the Renyi divergences" [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

Response:
According to the 'Revisiting randomized choices' paper, applying a non-uniformly-random choice of variables and/or split thresholds can make "clustered" diverse outliers more easily identifiable [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

The paper defines "clustered" outliers as those originating from a repeated process, such as fraudulent activity, which makes them a more "interesting" class of outliers compared to "scattered" outliers that come from unrelated events [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021]. These clustered outliers, particularly those in multi-modal datasets, are considered among the hardest classes to detect [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

Experiments in the paper showed that for clustered outliers from multimodal datasets (e.g., "Arrythmia", "Satellite"), tree-based models with non-uniformly-random splits provided an "edge" and were better at identifying them [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021]. The proposed guiding heuristic, which uses a non-uniform split choice, was found to offer increased performance for these specific types of outliers. However, this improvement comes at a cost, as it leads to degraded performance in detecting other classes of outliers, indicating there is no single "silver bullet" method for all outlier types [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the Kernel Isolation Forest is designed to analyze hyperspectral images (HSIs) for the purpose of anomaly detection [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

Specifically, the application domain is hyperspectral remotely sensed images, which contain hundreds or even thousands of spectral bands [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019]. The goal of the method is to distinguish interesting targets that are spatially or spectrally different from their surrounding background without any prior knowledge of the target or background signatures [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019]. This type of analysis is important for applications such as military defense, search-and-rescue, mine detection, and environmental monitoring [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019]. The paper evaluates the method on several real hyperspectral data sets from sensors like AVIRIS and HYDICE [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the main advantage of Generalized Isolation Forest (GIF) over Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) is its significantly improved computational performance and faster execution time [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

This advantage stems from GIF's ability to avoid creating "empty branches," which is a common inefficiency and drawback in the EIF algorithm [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. Empty branches occur in EIF when a randomly chosen hyperplane fails to separate any data points, leading to wasted computations and increased tree complexity without contributing to the isolation of data [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. The probability of generating these empty branches in EIF rises with tree depth, adding to the computational overhead [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

GIF's fundamental difference is in its splitting process. Instead of selecting a hyperplane randomly within a hypercube, GIF selects a hyperplane that is guaranteed to pass through the data's convex hull. This ensures that the data is always partitioned into two non-empty subsets [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. By generating trees with no empty branches, GIF achieves a significant reduction in computation time compared to EIF, while maintaining a similar level of anomaly detection performance [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].
