Response:
Based on the provided context, the standard Isolation Forest produces artifacts in anomaly score heat maps that create "artificial zones of higher/lower scores" which are not present in the original data [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. These artifacts are generated by the algorithm's branching procedure, which slices data using hyperplanes parallel to the coordinate axes [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

The specific appearance of the artifact depends on the data's distribution:

*   **For a single cluster of normally distributed data**, the score map should be circular. Instead, the standard Isolation Forest produces a map with "distinct horizontal and vertical bands of higher anomaly scores" that create a cross-like shape [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This results in "rectangular regions of lower anomaly score in the x and y directions" compared to other points at the same radial distance [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].
*   **For two separate clusters of data**, the algorithm creates similar rectangular bands aligned with the cluster centers. At the intersection of these bands, it produces "'ghost' clusters" in areas where no data exists. This could cause a truly anomalous data point located in that region to be miscategorized as nominal [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].
*   **For data with a non-linear (e.g., sinusoidal) structure**, the standard Isolation Forest fails to capture the underlying pattern. It treats the data as a "single rectangular blob" instead of following the curve of the data [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

These artifacts are problematic because they can increase the chance of false positives, wrongly indicate a non-existent structure in the data, and reduce the overall reliability of the algorithm [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. Extended Isolation Forest aims to fix this by allowing branching hyperplanes to have random slopes, which "completely resolves the bias" and removes the artifacts from the score maps [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Response:
The standard Isolation Forest algorithm suffers from a bias that originates from its tree-branching process [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. The branching procedure slices data using cuts that are always parallel to the coordinate frame, which introduces a bias based on the location of a data point relative to these axes. This results in inconsistent anomaly scores and creates "artificial zones of higher/lower scores which are not present in the original data" [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) fixes this issue by generalizing the branching process [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. The key modification is that EIF allows the branching hyperplanes to have random slopes, meaning they are not restricted to being parallel to the coordinate axes [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This extension "completely resolves the bias introduced in the case of standard Isolation Forest" [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

The algorithm has multiple "extension levels." As the extension level increases, the bias of the algorithm is reduced. The lowest extension level, Ex = 0, is identical to the standard Isolation Forest algorithm [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

The paper also discusses another method to improve the standard algorithm, which involves rotating the data by a random angle before the construction of each tree. While this improves score robustness by averaging out the biases from each tree, it is considered a less desirable solution than EIF because each tree still suffers from the underlying rectangular bias; the problem is "not resolved, but only averaged out" [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. Therefore, EIF is presented as the preferred approach [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the Functional Isolation Forest (FIF) algorithm projects functional data by using a combination of a dictionary and a scalar product [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

The process is as follows:
1.  **Projection as a Feature:** To handle the complexity of functional data, FIF projects observations onto elements of a chosen dictionary `D`. For a given function `x` from a Hilbert space `H` and a dictionary element `d` from `D`, the projection is defined by the scalar product `(x, d)_H`. This projection value serves as a feature that partially describes the function `x` [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].
2.  **Splitting Mechanism:** The set of projections on all dictionary elements provides a rich representation of the data. In the tree-building process, an element `d` is drawn from the dictionary to serve as a *Split variable*. A *Split value* is then uniformly selected from the range of projections of the current data onto `d`. This is used to partition the data at each node of the tree [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].
3.  **Flexibility of Dictionaries and Scalar Products:** The choice of both the dictionary and the scalar product offers great flexibility. The dictionary can be deterministic, stochastic, or even consist of the data itself (a *self-data dictionary*) [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019]. The scalar product can be chosen to target different types of anomalies. For example, the L₂ scalar product is used for detecting *location anomalies*, whereas the L₂ scalar product of derivatives can detect *shape anomalies*. A combination of both can be used to account for location and shape simultaneously [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].
4.  **Extension to Multivariate Functions:** FIF can be extended to multivariate functional data where each observation lies in R^d for each moment in time. For this, the projection is defined as the coordinate-wise sum of the `d` corresponding scalar products: `(f, g)_{H^⊗d} := ∑_{i=1}^d (f⁽ⁱ⁾, g⁽ⁱ⁾)_H` [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

Response:
According to the provided context, the assumption that anomalies are more susceptible to isolation is based on two combined principles: the nature of anomalies and the function of kernel methods [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

1.  **Isolation Forest (iForest) Principle**: The iForest method is based on the assumption that anomaly instances are "rare and different from those of normal instances" [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019]. Because of these differences, such as having distinct spectral values, anomalies are more easily isolated within binary tree structures than background pixels [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019]. This means anomalous instances require fewer partitions to be isolated and thus have "noticeable shorter average path lengths" than normal instances, which are harder to separate from the main cluster [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019]. For example, a graphical interpretation shows an outlier point ('xa') requires only four lines to be isolated, whereas an inlier point ('xb') requires thirteen [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

2.  **Kernel Method Enhancement**: Kernel methods project input data into a higher-dimensional feature space. The goal of this mapping is to make classes that are not linearly separable in the original space become more separable in the new, higher-dimensional space [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019]. By first projecting the hyperspectral data into a kernel space, the method aims to "better separate the anomaly and background" [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019]. Therefore, the central idea of the Kernel Isolation Forest method is that anomalies are even "more susceptible to isolation in the kernel space" because this mapping enhances the separability between the distinct anomalies and the background data [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

Evaluation Status: ANSWERABLE

Response:
Generalized Isolation Forest (GIF) improves upon Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) by generating trees without any empty branches, which is a common inefficiency in EIF [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

In EIF, random hyperplanes are used to split the data, but the sampled threshold might lead to empty branches, which increases the complexity and computation time of the trees [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. These empty branches occur when the intercept points for the splits are sampled outside the convex hull of the data [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

To solve this, the GIF algorithm modifies the splitting process. It first projects all data points onto a random normal unit vector. Then, it finds the minimum and maximum values among these projections and samples a split value uniformly *between* these two values. This strategy ensures that there is at least one data point in each new branch, as the split is bounded by the extreme points of the data along that vector. This is equivalent to reducing the sampling volume from the axis-bounding hypercube used in EIF to the convex hull of the data, making the probability of creating an empty branch zero [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

By avoiding empty branches, GIF is significantly faster than EIF while achieving similar performance [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the K-Means Isolation Forest (IF) algorithm combines its partitioning strategy with K-Means clustering in the following way:

The K-Means-based Isolation Forest departs from the classic binary search tree structure used in the standard Isolation Forest [K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020]. Instead of splitting a node into only two branches, the K-Means algorithm is used to determine the number of branches at each node of the decision tree [K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].

The process at each node is as follows:
1.  K-Means clustering is applied to the data sub-partition at that specific node [K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].
2.  The "elbow rule" is used to find the optimal number of clusters for that subset of data [K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].
3.  This optimal number of clusters then determines the number of leaves (branches) for that node. The clusters and their limits create these new leaves, and the process can be repeated for each subsequent sub-partition [K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].

This method divides the data into clusters based on the data's structure, rather than making random splits. This results in search trees that are described as "wider" but not as deep as those in the standard Isolation Forest [K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020]. Additionally, the anomaly score is quantified using the membership value of a point to its respective cluster at each split [K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].

Based on the provided context, the two novel hybrid algorithms introduced in the "Extended K-Means Isolation Forest" paper are:

Response:
Based on the provided context, the Probabilistic Generalization of Isolation Forest (PGIF) uses segment-cumulated probability to enhance the selection of split points when building its isolation trees [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. This approach assigns a probability to each segment between neighboring data points, making splits more likely to occur in sparse, inter-cluster regions rather than within dense clusters [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

The process is as follows:
1.  **Probability Calculation**: PGIF calculates a probability value, `P`, for each segment. This is based on the length of the segment (the difference between neighboring data points) raised to a power [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. The formula for the probability of a split value belonging to the i-th segment is `P_i = F_x_i,x_i+1_(x) / s`, where `s` is a normalization factor ensuring the sum of all segment probabilities is 1 [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].
2.  **Random Number Generation**: A random number, `c`, is drawn from a uniform distribution within the interval [0, 1) [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].
3.  **Segment Selection Loop**: The algorithm iterates through the segments to select one. A loop is performed as long as the cumulated probability of the currently considered segment (`P_i`) is lower than the random number `c` [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].
4.  **Probability Subtraction**: Inside the loop, the value of `c` is decreased by the cumulated probability of the current segment (`P_i`) [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].
5.  **Split Value Calculation**: Once the loop terminates, a segment has been selected. The final value of `c` is used with an inverted cumulative probability function, based on an applied kernel `K`, to calculate the final split value within that segment [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the Rényi divergence is used to define and prove the properties of a generalized family of aggregation functions for Isolation Forests [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

The paper introduces a family of aggregation functions `h_α(x) = 2^{−f_α(x)}` which are parameterized by a single parameter α [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023]. The functions `f_α` are linked to information theory through the α-Rényi divergence via the identity:

`f_α(x) = exp(-R_α(\frac{x}{||x||_1} || \frac{1}{n}))`

where **1** represents a vector of ones [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

The α-Rényi divergence, `R_α(p||q)`, is defined for `α ∈ (0, 1) ∪ (1,∞)` as:

`R_α(p||q) = \frac{1}{α-1} ln \sum_{i=1}^d p_i^α q_i^{1-α}`

The Rényi divergences generalize the Kullback-Leibler divergence and are used in information theory. The properties of the functions `f_α` (and thus the aggregation functions `h_α`) are a "direct consequence of the properties of the Renyi divergences" [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023]. This connection is used to show that the aggregation functions `h_α` are monotonically increasing in α and interpolate between the standard Isolation Forest aggregation function (`h_0`) and the maximum function (`h_∞`) [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

Response:
Based on the provided context, applying a non-uniformly-random choice of variables and/or split thresholds in isolation forests can make "clustered" diverse outliers easier to identify [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021]. Clustered outliers are considered a more "interesting" and harder-to-identify class of anomalies that may originate from a repeated process, such as fraudulent activity [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

The paper's analysis found that non-uniformly-random splits provide an "edge" in identifying clustered outliers from multi-modal datasets, which are often the most difficult to flag. The proposed Fair-Cut Forest (FCF) algorithm, which uses a non-uniform split guiding heuristic, was shown to offer increased performance for these specific types of outliers [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

However, this improved detection comes with a trade-off. Methods that use non-uniform splitting to improve performance on clustered outliers may see degraded performance on other classes of outliers, such as those found in minority-in-binary-class datasets [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

Based on the provided context, the Kernel Isolation Forest (KIFD) method is designed to analyze **hyperspectral images (HSIs)** for the purpose of **anomaly detection** [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

HSIs are described as remotely sensed images that "contain hundreds or even thousands of spectral bands" [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019]. The goal of hyperspectral anomaly detection is to distinguish targets that are "very different spatially or spectrally from their surrounding background with no a prior knowledge about the spectral signatures of background and target" [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

The paper mentions that this application domain has considerable interest due to its importance in "military defense, search-and-rescue, mine detection, and environmental monitoring" [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019]. The method was evaluated on real hyperspectral data sets, including one acquired by the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) covering the San Diego airport area [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the main advantage of Generalized Isolation Forest (GIF) over Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) is its significantly faster computation time [Lesouple et al., 2021; Birsan, 2025].

This speed improvement is because the GIF algorithm is designed to generate trees without creating "empty branches," which is a drawback of the EIF method [Lesouple et al., 2021]. EIF's strategy of using random hyperplanes can lead to many empty branches, which increases the complexity of the trees in the forest [Lesouple et al., 2021; Birsan, 2025]. By avoiding this issue, GIF "significantly improves the execution times when compared to EIF" [Lesouple et al., 2021]. Experiments confirm that the time required to compute the forests is "significantly smaller for GIF compared to EIF" [Lesouple et al., 2021]. This advantage in speed is achieved while maintaining a globally similar performance in anomaly detection [Lesouple et al., 2021].
