Response:
Based on the provided context, the specific artifact that the standard Isolation Forest (IF) produces in anomaly score heat maps are artificial bands or regions of inconsistent scores that are not present in the original data distribution [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

This artifact is described as:
*   "Distinct horizontal and vertical bands of higher anomaly scores" [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].
*   "Rectangular regions of lower anomaly score in the x and y directions" when compared to other points at a similar distance from the center of a data cluster [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].
*   "Artificial zones of higher/lower scores" which create inconsistent anomaly scores within the domain [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].
*   "Stripes parallel to the axis" where data has a lower anomaly score [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

The cause of this artifact is the branching procedure in the standard Isolation Forest algorithm. The algorithm creates splits using hyperplanes that are always parallel to the coordinate axes (i.e., the branch cuts are "always either horizontal or vertical") [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. This introduces a bias based on a data point's location relative to the coordinate frame [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. As a result, two points of similar importance or distance from a data cluster might receive very different anomaly scores, which reduces the algorithm's reliability [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) aims to fix this by allowing the branching hyperplanes to have random slopes, meaning they are no longer restricted to being parallel to the coordinate axes. This approach "completely resolves the bias" and remedies the artifacts seen in the anomaly score heat maps [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Response:
The standard Isolation Forest algorithm suffers from an "axis-parallel" bias because its method of building trees involves splitting data only along coordinate axes, using random values of randomly selected features [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This introduces a bias dependent on the data point's location relative to the coordinate frame, which in turn creates inconsistent anomaly scores and artificial zones of higher or lower scores that are not present in the actual data [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. Due to these axis-parallel cuts, the standard algorithm struggles to capture correlations between features [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) fixes this bias by generalizing the splitting condition. Instead of using axis-parallel cuts, EIF allows the branching hyperplanes to have random slopes, meaning they can take on any orientation and are not restricted to being parallel to the coordinate frame [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021]. This extension completely resolves the bias found in the standard algorithm [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. By using hyperplanes with arbitrary slopes, EIF can capture more complex dependencies and eliminate the artificial "ghost regions" seen in standard IF score maps [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. This leads to more robust and reliable anomaly scores with significantly lower variance, particularly in regions of high anomaly [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the Functional Isolation Forest (FIF) algorithm projects data by using a combination of a dictionary and a scalar product to create features for splitting nodes in its trees [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

The process involves several components:

*   **Function Representation through Projection:** To handle the complexity of functional data, FIF projects observations onto elements of a chosen dictionary, D. For a given function `x` and a dictionary element `d`, the projection is defined by the scalar product `(x, d)_H`. This projection serves as a feature that partially describes the function `x` [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019]. The collection of all such projections for every element in the dictionary provides a rich set of candidate "Split variables" [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

*   **Sampling and Splitting:** The construction of a tree (F-itree) follows these steps:
    1.  **Sampling a Split Variable:** A "Split variable" `d` is drawn from the dictionary `D` according to a defined probability distribution `ν` [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].
    2.  **Sampling a Split Value:** For the chosen `d`, a "Split value" `κ` is uniformly drawn from the real interval defined by the minimum and maximum values of the projections `(x, d)_H` for all observations present in the current node [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].
    3.  **Creating Children Subsets:** The data is then partitioned into two subsets based on this projection. One subset contains functions `x` where `(x, d)_H ≤ κ`, and the other contains functions where `(x, d)_H > κ` [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

*   **Flexibility via Dictionaries and Scalar Products:** The choice of both the dictionary and the scalar product provides flexibility to detect different types of anomalies [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].
    *   **Dictionaries:** A variety of dictionaries can be used, such as the *mexican hat wavelet dictionary*, *Brownian motion dictionary*, *cosine dictionary*, or even the dataset itself (*self-data dictionary*). These dictionaries can incorporate prior knowledge about the data [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].
    *   **Scalar Products:** The scalar product can be chosen to target specific anomalies. For instance, an L2 scalar product helps detect "location anomalies," whereas an L2 scalar product of derivatives can identify "shape anomalies" [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019]. A combination of both can be used to detect a wider variety of deviations [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

*   **Extension to Multivariate Data:** For multivariate functional data, the projection is defined using a coordinate-wise sum of the scalar products for each of the `d` dimensions: `(f, g)_{H^⊗d} := ∑_{i=1}^d (f⁽ⁱ⁾, g⁽ⁱ⁾)_H` [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

Response:
Based on the provided context, anomalies are assumed to be more susceptible to isolation for two main reasons, which are enhanced by the use of a kernel space:

1.  **The Nature of Anomalies and Isolation Forest (iForest):** The fundamental assumption of the iForest algorithm is that anomalies are "rare and different" from normal instances. In hyperspectral imaging, this means they usually have different spectral values compared to the background. This inherent difference makes them easier to isolate in the binary tree structures that iForest constructs [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

2.  **The Role of the Kernel Space:** Kernel methods project the input data into a higher-dimensional feature space. This is done with the hope that classes that are not linearly separable in the original space will become more separable in the new, higher-dimensional space [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019]. By applying a kernel method, the goal is to "better separate the anomaly and background" [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

Therefore, the paper's central idea is that by first using a kernel method to map the data into a feature space where anomalies and background are more distinct and separable, the iForest algorithm can then more effectively and easily isolate those anomalies [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the Generalized Isolation Forest (GIF) improves upon the Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) by employing a different splitting strategy that guarantees no empty branches are created in its decision trees [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

EIF can generate empty branches, which is an inefficiency where a random cut may not separate any data points [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. This occurs when EIF samples intercepts for its splitting hyperplanes outside the convex hull of the data but inside the axis-bounding hypercube. The probability of this happening increases with the number of dimensions, a problem known as the curse of dimensionality [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

To solve this, GIF modifies the splitting process. The algorithm first projects all data points onto a randomly sampled normal unit vector. It then identifies the minimum and maximum values among these projections and samples a split value uniformly *only* from the range between these minimum and maximum values [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

This strategy ensures that there is always at least one data point in each of the two resulting branches of a tree, thereby eliminating the possibility of empty branches. In GIF, the probability of sampling an intercept that leads to an empty branch is zero [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. By generating trees without any empty branches, GIF significantly improves execution times and is computationally faster than EIF [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

Response:
The K-Means Isolation Forest (K-Means IF) algorithm combines its partition strategy with K-Means clustering by using the clustering algorithm at each node to determine how the data should be divided [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].

The process at each tree node is as follows:
1.  A random component (feature) is selected, and all data points in the current node are projected onto it, creating a 1-dimensional space [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
2.  The K-Means clustering algorithm is then applied to this 1-dimensional data to find the optimal number of clusters, `k`. The value of `k` is determined using the "elbow-rule" [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].
3.  Instead of a single binary split, the node is partitioned into `k` branches, where each branch corresponds to one of the identified clusters. This results in a multi-branch tree structure rather than a strictly binary one [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].
4.  Each data point is assigned to a child node based on the cluster it most likely belongs to, determined by its distance to the cluster's centroid [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. The boundaries for this assignment are hyperplanes perpendicular to the randomly chosen component [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

This "density-aware" partitioning strategy allows the tree structure to adapt to the local density of the data, as the divisions are based on natural clusters rather than purely random splits [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].

Response:
The Probabilistic Generalization of Isolation Forest (PGIF) is an enhancement of the original Isolation Forest (IF) algorithm that uses segment-cumulated probability to achieve more effective splits that are performed between data clusters rather than through them [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

The process works as follows:

1.  **Calculating Segment Probabilities:** The algorithm first identifies the segments between neighboring data points and calculates their lengths. It then assigns a probability to each segment based on a "nonlinear dependence" on the segment's length. Specifically, the probability is proportional to the segment length raised to the power of `k+1` [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. These probabilities are then normalized by dividing each by their total sum, `s`, ensuring the total probability is 1 [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. This results in wider gaps between clusters having a much higher probability of being chosen for a split compared to the narrower gaps within clusters [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

2.  **Selecting a Segment for the Split:** To generate a split value, the algorithm first generates a uniform random real number, `c`, between 0 and 1. It then iterates through the segments, comparing the random number `c` to the cumulated probability of the currently considered segment, `P_i`. The loop continues while `c` is greater than the current segment's probability, and in each iteration, `c` is decreased by that segment's probability. This process effectively selects a segment to split based on its assigned probability [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

3.  **Determining the Split Point:** Once a segment is selected, the final split value, `x_g`, is calculated within that segment using an inverted cumulative probability function [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

By using this probabilistic approach based on segment length, PGIF assigns higher anomaly scores to the intra-cluster regions and is more effective at detecting anomalies hidden between clusters [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the Rényi divergence is related to the aggregation functions through an intermediate function, `f_α`, which is used to generalize the score function in Isolation Forests [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

The paper introduces a family of aggregation functions, `h_α(x)`, defined as `h_α(x) = 2^−f_α(x)` [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023]. The connection to information theory is established through the function `f_α(x)`, which is linked to the α-Rényi divergence via the identity:

`f_α(x) = exp(-R_α(x/||x||_1 || 1/n))`

where `R_α` is the α-Rényi divergence and **1** is the vector of ones [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

The α-Rényi divergence for `α ∈ (0, 1) ∪ (1,∞)` is defined as:

`R_α(p||q) = (1/(α-1)) * ln Σ(p_i^α * q_i^(1-α))`

This connection is used to clarify the properties of the `f_α` functions, as they are a "direct consequence of the properties of the Renyi divergences" [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

Response:
Based on the provided context, applying a non-uniformly-random choice for splitting variables and/or thresholds can make "clustered" diverse outliers more easily identifiable [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

The paper states that different split guiding criteria, which are non-uniform, can lead to "significantly better outlier discrimination for certain classes of outliers" [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021]. Specifically, experiments showed that for "clustered outliers from multimodal datasets," which are often of "utmost interest," models using non-uniformly-random splits provided an "edge" [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

The paper's proposed heuristic, which uses a non-uniform split choice, was found to offer "increased performance for the outliers of utmost interest (clustered outliers from multi-modal datasets)" [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021]. However, this improvement comes at a cost, as it results in "degraded performance in other classes of outliers" [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

"Clustered" outliers are distinguished from "scattered" outliers, with the former being considered more "interesting" as they typically originate from a repeated process, such as fraudulent activity [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

Based on the provided context, the main advantage of Generalized Isolation Forest (GIF) over Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) is its significantly faster computation time [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

These empty branches are a common inefficiency in EIF, where random hyperplane cuts may fail to separate any data, thereby increasing the complexity of the trees and slowing down execution [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].
