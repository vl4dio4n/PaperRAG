Response:
Based on the provided context, the standard Isolation Forest produces artifacts in its anomaly score heat maps, which Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) is designed to fix. These artifacts are generated by the algorithm's binary tree branching criteria [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

The specific artifacts are:

*   **Horizontal and Vertical Bands:** For a single cluster of data, the standard Isolation Forest creates "distinct horizontal and vertical bands of higher anomaly scores" or "rectangular regions of lower anomaly score in the x and y directions" [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This causes the anomaly score map, which should be circular for normally distributed data, to look like a "rounded square" with an artifact resembling a cross [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].
*   **"Ghost" Clusters:** In scenarios with multiple data clusters, these horizontal and vertical bands are aligned with the cluster centers. The artifact is amplified where these bands intersect, creating "ghost" clusters in areas where no actual data exists [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. For example, with data clusters around (0,10) and (10,0), ghost clusters might appear near (0,0) and (10,10) [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

These artifacts are problematic because they can lead to the misclassification of data points, increase false positives, reduce the algorithm's reliability, and incorrectly indicate a non-existent structure in the data [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. The Extended Isolation Forest remedies this issue by allowing the data to be sliced with hyperplanes of random slopes, which results in the artifacts being "completely gone" [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Response:
The standard Isolation Forest algorithm suffers from a bias that arises from its branching procedure, which slices data using hyperplanes parallel to the coordinate frame. This creates "artificial zones of higher/lower scores which are not present in the original data" [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

To fix this issue, Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) modifies the branching process by allowing the "branching hyperplanes to take on any slope" instead of being restricted to cuts parallel to the coordinate frame [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This use of hyperplanes with random slopes is the preferred of two proposed methods and "completely resolves the bias" found in the standard algorithm [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

EIF is a more general case of the standard algorithm and possesses multiple "levels of extensions" for an N-dimensional dataset. The lowest extension level (Ex = 0) is identical to the standard Isolation Forest. As the extension level increases, the bias of the algorithm is reduced [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This improved method results in "remarkably smaller variances" in anomaly scores, and these variances decrease as the extension level increases [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. The authors also proposed a secondary, less desirable method of rotating the data randomly before the construction of each tree, which helps by averaging out the bias but does not fix it within individual trees [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Response:
The Functional Isolation Forest (FIF) algorithm projects functional data by using a scalar product to project an observation onto an element of a chosen dictionary [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

The projection of a function `x` onto a dictionary element `d` is defined by the scalar product `(x, d)_H`. This projection creates a feature, also known as a "Split variable," that provides a partial description of the function `x` [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019]. The combined choice of the dictionary and the scalar product gives FIF the flexibility to detect a variety of anomalies [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

**Role of the Dictionary:**
*   A dictionary `D` is a set of functions chosen to be rich enough to explore different properties of the data [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].
*   It provides a set of candidate "Split variables." For each split in a tree, a Split variable `d` is drawn from the dictionary according to a defined probability distribution [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].
*   The dictionary can incorporate *a priori* information or expert knowledge about the data. It can consist of deterministic functions, stochastic elements, the observations themselves, or a mixture of these. Examples of dictionaries used in the paper include the Mexican hat wavelet, Brownian motion, Brownian bridge, cosine, and self-data dictionaries [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

**Role of the Scalar Product:**
*   The choice of scalar product provides flexibility to measure different types of anomalies [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].
*   An L₂ scalar product allows for the detection of "location anomalies," while an L₂ scalar product of the derivatives can detect anomalies related to "shape" [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].
*   A combination can be used to account for both location and shape, such as the suggested product: (f, g) := α × (f,g)L₂ / (||f|| ||g||) + (1 − α) × (f', g')L₂ / (||f'|| ||g'||) [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

For multivariate functional data, the projection is extended by using the coordinate-wise sum of the scalar products for each of the `d` dimensions: (f, g)H⊗d := ∑ᵢ₌₁ᵈ (f⁽ⁱ⁾, g⁽ⁱ⁾)H [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the Generalized Isolation Forest (GIF) improves upon the Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) by modifying the splitting process to prevent the creation of "empty branches" [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

The issue with EIF is that its use of random hyperplanes can lead to cuts that do not separate any data, resulting in empty branches. This is a common inefficiency that increases tree complexity [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. Empty branches in EIF occur when intercepts are sampled outside the convex hull of the data but inside the axis-bounding hypercube. The probability of this happening increases with the number of dimensions due to the "curse of dimensionality" [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

GIF solves this problem with the following strategy:
1.  All data points are projected onto a randomly sampled normal unit vector [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].
2.  The algorithm identifies the minimum and maximum values among these projections [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].
3.  A split value is then sampled uniformly *between* these minimum and maximum values [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

This sampling method ensures that there is at least one data point in each of the two resulting branches, guaranteeing that no branches are empty [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. By reducing the sampling volume to the convex hull of the data, the probability of sampling an intercept that leads to an empty branch becomes zero for GIF [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. This makes GIF computationally faster than EIF without sacrificing detection accuracy [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

Response:
The K-Means Isolation Forest algorithm departs from the classic Isolation Forest's binary search tree structure by incorporating K-Means clustering to create a search tree with multiple branches at each node [K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].

The combination of the partition strategy and K-Means works as follows:

1.  **Determining Divisions:** At each node in the decision tree, instead of making a random binary split, the K-Means clustering algorithm is used to determine the number of divisions. The algorithm applies the "elbow rule" to the data in the current sub-partition to find the optimal number of clusters, `c` [K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].
2.  **Creating Branches:** This optimal number of clusters, `c`, dictates the number of branches (or "leafs") for that node. The clusters and their calculated limits create these new partitions, and the process is repeated for each new leaf [K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020]. This allows the algorithm to fit the data during the tree-building step, dividing the dataset into clusters based on the data's structure rather than making random splits [K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].
3.  **Calculating Anomaly Score:** The anomaly score is also integrated with the clustering. The score is quantified using a point's membership value to its cluster. The final anomaly score for a record is the sum of its membership grades for the clusters it belongs to at each split in the tree [K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].

2.  **Extended K-Means Isolation Forest (EKM-IF)**: This approach projects data onto random oblique hyperplanes prior to using clustering for partitioning. It is designed to combine the geometric flexibility of Extended IF with the density-aware partitioning of K-Means IF [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the Probabilistic Generalization of Isolation Forest (PGIF) uses segment-cumulated probability to generate data splits in a more meaningful way than the original Isolation Forest algorithm [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. The core of the PGIF method is a generalization based on the "nonlinear dependence of segment-cumulated probability from the length of segment" [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

The process works as follows:

1.  **Assigning Probabilities:** PGIF assigns probabilities to different regions of the data space by creating a piecewise defined probability density function. This function is defined on the segments between neighboring data points [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. The goal is to assign lower probability density to densely populated clusters and higher probability density to the emptier, out-of-cluster regions, or gaps [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].
2.  **Calculating Segment Probabilities:** The probability `P` for a given segment is calculated based on its length (`D_i`) raised to a power (`k+1`). This ensures that longer segments (gaps) are given a higher probability weight [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].
3.  **Generating Splits:** To generate a split value, the algorithm first draws a random number, `c`, from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1. It then uses an inverted cumulative probability function to determine the split value. This is implemented via a loop where the random value `c` is compared against the cumulated probability of the segments (`P_i`) to find the correct segment in which to place the split [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

The cumulative probability function for generating a split value `x_g` is defined by the formula:
`P(x ≤ x_g) = ∑^{m-1}_{i=1} P_i + ∫^{x_g}_{x_m} p_m(x)dx`
where `P_i` is the probability of the i-th segment and `p_m(x)` is the probability density function for the m-th segment [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

By using this approach, PGIF ensures that splits are more likely to be performed between clusters rather than through them. This makes it more probable that an outlier, which is typically separated from other data by a wide gap, will be isolated earlier in the tree-building process [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the Rényi divergence is used to define and prove the properties of a family of aggregation functions, `h_α`, which are proposed as a generalization of the standard score function in Isolation Forests [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

The relationship is established through the function `f_α(x)`, which is a component of the aggregation function `h_α(x) = 2^(−f_α(x))`. The function `f_α(x)` is directly linked to the α-Rényi divergence, `R_α`, via the following identity:

`f_α(x) = exp(-R_α(x/||x||_1 || 1/n))`

In this equation, **1** represents the vector of ones. This connection to information theory is used to demonstrate the claimed properties of `f_α`, as they are a "direct consequence of the properties of the Renyi divergences" [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023]. The Rényi divergences themselves generalize the Kullback-Leibler divergence and have various uses in information theory [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

Response:
According to the 'Revisiting randomized choices' paper, applying a non-uniformly-random choice for variables or split thresholds can make "clustered" outliers more easily identifiable [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021]. Clustered outliers are considered an interesting and difficult class to detect, often originating from repeated processes like fraudulent activity [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

The paper states that for clustered outliers in multimodal datasets, which are often the hardest to flag, non-uniformly-random splits provide an "edge" and lead to better identification compared to other methods [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021]. For example, the proposed Fair-Cut Forest (FCF) model, which uses a non-uniform, deterministic split threshold, was found to offer increased performance for clustered outliers. This is because its splitting criterion produces more "natural separations," which is particularly useful in clustered or multimodal distributions [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

However, this improved performance on clustered outliers comes at a cost, as it can lead to degraded performance in detecting other classes of outliers [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

Based on the provided context, the Kernel Isolation Forest (KIFD) method is designed to analyze hyperspectral remotely sensed images, also referred to as hyperspectral images (HSI) [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

The specific application domain is hyperspectral anomaly detection, which aims to distinguish targets that are spatially or spectrally different from their surrounding background without prior knowledge of their signatures. This has applications in fields such as military defense, search-and-rescue, mine detection, and environmental monitoring [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

Response:
The main advantage of Generalized Isolation Forest (GIF) over Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) is its improved computation time, which is achieved by avoiding the creation of "empty branches" during tree construction [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

The EIF algorithm's strategy of using random hyperplanes for splitting can lead to a significant number of empty branches, where a cut separates no data [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. This is a common inefficiency that increases the complexity of the trees and, consequently, the algorithm's execution time [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

GIF refines the splitting process specifically to prevent this issue. It generates trees without any empty branches by projecting the data onto a random vector and sampling a split value between the minimum and maximum projected values, which ensures that at least one data point falls into each new branch [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. By eliminating this inefficiency, GIF significantly reduces the time required to compute the forests compared to EIF, while maintaining similar anomaly detection performance [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].
