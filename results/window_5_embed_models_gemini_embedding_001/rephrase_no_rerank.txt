Response:
Based on the provided context, the standard Isolation Forest produces several specific artifacts in anomaly score heat maps that the Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) is designed to fix. These artifacts are a result of a bias introduced by the algorithm's branching criteria, which restricts data splits to be parallel to the coordinate axes [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

The specific artifacts include:

*   **Horizontal and Vertical Bands:** For a single cluster of data points that should produce a circular score map, the standard Isolation Forest instead creates "distinct horizontal and vertical bands" and "rectangular regions of lower anomaly score in the x and y directions" [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. These artificial zones have inconsistent scores that are not representative of the actual data distribution [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].
*   **"Ghost" Clusters:** When dealing with multiple data clusters, the axis-parallel cuts create strong vertical and horizontal bands that intersect, resulting in "ghost" regions or "ghost" clusters in the score map where no actual data clusters exist [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
*   **Failure to Capture Data Structure:** In cases with more complex data distributions, such as a sine curve, the standard algorithm fails to capture the underlying structure and may incorrectly treat the data as a single rectangular blob [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

The Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) remedies these issues by allowing data splits to be made using hyperplanes with random slopes, rather than only cuts that are parallel to the axes. This approach eliminates the artifacts, resulting in score maps that more accurately represent the data's structure, such as being nearly perfectly circular for a single data blob and free of ghost clusters for multiple blobs [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Response:
The standard Isolation Forest (IF) algorithm suffers from a bias that arises from its method of creating tree branches [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. The standard algorithm generates splits one variable at a time, resulting in "axis-parallel" or "rectangular" cuts that are always horizontal or vertical [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021; Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This introduces artifacts in the anomaly score map, creating "artificial zones of higher/lower scores which are not present in the original data" [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. As a result, anomaly scores can vary significantly based on a data point's alignment with the coordinate axes rather than its true anomalous nature, which can increase the chance of false positives [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) fixes this bias by generalizing the branching process [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. The core change is that EIF does not restrict splits to be axis-parallel. Instead, it uses "hyperplanes with random slopes (non-axis-parallel)" for splitting the data [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021]. At each branching point, a hyperplane with a random slope is generated by randomly selecting a normal vector and an intercept point [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

This approach "completely resolves the bias" by removing the restriction that branch cuts must be parallel to the coordinate frame [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This leads to more robust and reliable anomaly scores with "remarkably smaller variances" compared to the standard algorithm, especially in regions of high anomaly likelihood [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

An alternative method to mitigate the bias is to randomly rotate the data before constructing each tree. This helps average out the bias when the scores from all trees are aggregated, but each individual tree still suffers from the rectangular bias. For this and other reasons, EIF's approach of using hyperplanes with random slopes is considered the more robust and preferred solution [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Evaluation Status: ANSWERABLE
Generating answer...
Response:
Based on the provided context, the Functional Isolation Forest (FIF) algorithm handles functional data by projecting observations onto elements of a chosen dictionary using a scalar product [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019]. This process creates features that can be used to split the data within the algorithm's tree structures [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

The projection mechanism works as follows:
*   **Projection:** Given a functional observation `x` from a Hilbert space `H` and a function `d` from a dictionary `D ⊂ H`, a feature is defined by the projection of `x` onto `d`. This projection is calculated using a scalar product, denoted as `(x, d)_H` [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].
*   **Split Variables and Values:** The elements `d` from the dictionary `D` are sampled to serve as "Split variables". The projection `(x, d)_H` yields a real number. A "Split value" is then uniformly drawn from the interval defined by the minimum and maximum projection values within a given data node, which is used to partition the data [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

The flexibility of FIF comes from the combined choice of the dictionary and the scalar product, which allows it to detect a variety of anomalies [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

**Role of the Dictionary (`D`)**
*   The dictionary is chosen to be rich enough to explore various properties of the data and can incorporate prior knowledge [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].
*   It can consist of deterministic functions, stochastic elements, the training data itself (a "self-data dictionary"), or a mixture of these [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].
*   Examples of dictionaries used include *mexican hat wavelet* (MHW), *Brownian motion* (B), *cosine* (Cos), *dyadic indicator* (DI), and *self-data* (Self) dictionaries [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

**Role of the Scalar Product (`(·,·)_H`)**
*   The scalar product provides additional flexibility to detect different types of anomalies [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].
*   An L₂ scalar product helps detect "location anomalies," while an L₂ scalar product of derivatives can detect "shape anomalies" [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].
*   A combination of these, like the Sobolev W_{1,2} scalar product, can be used to account for both location and shape simultaneously [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

**Extension to Multivariate Functions**
*   FIF can be extended to multivariate functional data. In this case, the projection is performed using the coordinate-wise sum of the corresponding scalar products for each dimension: `(f, g)_{H^⊗d} := ∑_{i=1}^d (f⁽ⁱ⁾, g⁽ⁱ⁾)_H` [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

Evaluation Status: ANSWERABLE
Generating answer...
Response:
Based on the context provided, Generalized Isolation Forest (GIF) improves upon Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) by employing a different splitting strategy that guarantees no empty branches are created in its trees [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

The key differences are:

*   **Cause of Empty Branches in EIF:** EIF uses random hyperplanes to split data, but its strategy can generate empty branches. This occurs when the intercepts for the splitting hyperplanes are sampled outside the convex hull of the data points but inside the axis-bounding hypercube. The probability of this happening increases with the number of dimensions due to the "curse of dimensionality" [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. These empty branches increase the complexity of the trees [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

*   **GIF's Solution:** To avoid empty branches, GIF projects all data points onto a randomly sampled normal unit vector. It then finds the minimum and maximum values among these projections and samples a split value uniformly *between* these two values. This sampling method ensures that there is at least one data point in each of the two resulting branches [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. This approach is equivalent to reducing the sampling volume to the convex hull of the data, making the probability of creating an empty branch zero [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

*   **Benefit of the Improvement:** By producing trees without any empty branches, GIF "significantly improves the execution times when compared to EIF" [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. Experiments show that the time required to create the forests is "significantly smaller for GIF compared to EIF" [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

Response:
The K-Means Isolation Forest (K-Means IF) algorithm integrates K-Means clustering into its partitioning strategy to create a multi-branch search tree that adapts to the local density of the data [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020]. This contrasts with the standard Isolation Forest, which uses only two branches per node [K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].

The process at each tree node is as follows:
1.  A component is randomly selected, and all data points at that node are projected onto it [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
2.  The K-Means clustering algorithm is then applied to this one-dimensional projection to determine the boundaries for partitioning [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
3.  The optimal number of clusters (and therefore branches), denoted as 'k', is identified using the "elbow-rule" [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].
4.  This creates a node with 'k' child nodes, with each data point being assigned to the cluster it most likely belongs to based on its distance to the cluster's centroid [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

This approach allows the method to fit the data during the tree-building step and create a tree structure where the number of leaves depends on the optimal number of clusters found in the data sub-partition [K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].

2.  **Extended K-Means Isolation Forest (EKM-IF)**: This algorithm projects data onto random oblique hyperplanes before clustering. This method combines the geometric flexibility of Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) with the density adaptability of K-Means IF [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

These two algorithms are introduced to extend the density-aware partitioning of the K-Means IF algorithm and address its limitations, particularly in high-dimensional spaces [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

Generating answer...
Response:
Based on the provided context, the Probabilistic Generalization of Isolation Forest (PGIF) uses segment-cumulated probability to guide where splits are made when building isolation trees [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. The goal is to perform splits between clusters of data points rather than through them, which helps to more effectively isolate outliers located in sparsely populated regions [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

The process is as follows:

1.  **Probability Assignment**: PGIF first builds an empirical, piecewise probability density function based on the training data. It assigns a probability, `Pi`, to each segment (the space between two neighboring data points). This "segment-cumulated probability" is derived from the length of the segment, with wider gaps between points being assigned a higher probability density [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. The probabilities for all segments are normalized to ensure their sum equals 1 [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

2.  **Segment Selection**: To generate a split value, PGIF uses an algorithm that selects a segment based on these assigned probabilities.
    *   A random number, `c`, is generated from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].
    *   A loop iterates through the segments. The loop continues as long as the probability of the current segment (`Pi`) is lower than the current value of `c` [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].
    *   Within the loop, `c` is decreased by the value of `Pi` for the segment being considered [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

3.  **Split Value Calculation**: Once the loop terminates, a specific segment has been selected. An inverted cumulative probability function is then used to calculate the final split value (`xg`) within that chosen segment, based on the remaining value of `c` [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

By using this method, PGIF makes it more probable that splits will occur in the wider gaps that separate clusters or isolate outliers, leading to a higher anomaly score for points in those regions [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the aggregation functions `h_α` relate to the Rényi divergence through an intermediate function, `f_α` [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

The paper introduces a family of aggregation functions defined as `h_α(x) = 2^{−f_α(x)}`. The connection to information theory is established through the function `f_α`, which is linked to the α-Rényi divergence via the identity:

`f_α(x) = exp(-R_α(x/||x||_1 || 1/n))`

Here, `R_α` represents the α-Rényi divergence. The paper states that the properties claimed for `f_α` (and by extension for the aggregation functions `h_α`) are a "direct consequence of the properties of the Renyi divergences" [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023]. The Rényi divergences are themselves a generalization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence and have various applications in information theory [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

Response:
According to the paper "Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests," applying a non-uniformly-random choice of variables and/or split thresholds can make it easier to identify "clustered" diverse outliers [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

The paper notes that "clustered" outliers, which may originate from a repeated process like fraudulent activity, are often considered more interesting but harder to identify than scattered outliers [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021]. These types of outliers are often found in multi-modal datasets, clustered around various minority modes [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

Experiments showed that for clustered outliers from multi-modal datasets (such as those in the "Arrythmia", "Satellite", and "SpamBase" datasets), non-uniformly-random splits provide an "edge" in detection [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021]. Specifically, the paper's proposed FCF algorithm, which uses a non-uniform heuristic, was found to offer increased performance for these particular outliers. However, this improved capability comes at the expense of degraded performance in detecting other classes of outliers [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

Generating answer...
Response:
Based on the provided context, the 'visual elbow rule' is a method used to define a threshold for anomaly detection in Functional Isolation Forest (FIF) experiments [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

The process involves plotting the sorted anomaly scores for all observations in a dataset. This plot often shows a clear "elbow" point that separates the high-scoring anomalies from the low-scoring normal data. A threshold is then set at this elbow to distinguish between normal and abnormal data points [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019]. An example of this is shown in an experiment with handwritten digits, where the visual elbow rule was applied to a plot of sorted scores to identify 15 anomalies, which included all ten digits from the minority class ('2's) and five unusually shaped digits from the majority class ('7's) [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

The elbow method is also described in a more general sense for determining an optimal number of clusters in a k-Means-based isolation forest. In that context, the clustering error is plotted against the number of clusters, and the "elbow" point in the resulting graph indicates the optimal number of clusters to use [K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the main advantage of Generalized Isolation Forest (GIF) over Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) is its significantly reduced computation and execution time [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

This speed improvement is achieved because the GIF algorithm generates trees without any "empty branches," which is a common inefficiency and drawback in the EIF algorithm [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. The random hyperplane strategy used by EIF can generate many empty branches, which increases the complexity of the trees in the forest. GIF's refined splitting process avoids this issue, leading to a significant improvement in execution times [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

Experiments show that the time required to compute the forests is "significantly smaller for GIF compared to EIF," while achieving a similar performance in anomaly detection [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].
