Response:
Based on the provided context, the standard Isolation Forest produces artifacts in anomaly score heat maps because its branching procedure is restricted to using orthogonal hyperplanes parallel to the coordinate axes [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This introduces a bias based on a data point's location relative to the coordinate frame, creating inconsistent anomaly scores and artificial zones of higher or lower scores not present in the original data [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Specific artifacts identified in the context include:

*   **Rectangular or Cross-Shaped Bands:** For normally distributed data that should have a circular anomaly score pattern, the standard Isolation Forest produces a map that is a "rounded square with darker red bands extending vertically and horizontally from the center," which resembles a cross [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. These are "rectangular regions of lower anomaly score in the x and y directions" compared to other points at the same distance from the center [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].
*   **"Ghost" Cluster Regions:** In datasets with multiple clusters, the axis-parallel branch cuts can intersect and form "ghost" cluster regions in the score map that do not correspond to the actual data distribution [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].
*   **Failure to Detect Complex Structures:** For data with an inherent non-linear structure, such as a sinusoidal shape, the standard algorithm performs poorly. It treats the data as "one large rectangular blob with horizontal and vertical bands emanating parallel to the coordinate axes," failing to detect the underlying pattern [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

The Extended Isolation Forest aims to fix these artifacts by utilizing hyperplanes with randomly chosen slopes for its branch cuts, rather than being restricted to axis-parallel splits [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This approach removes the artificial bands and "ghost" regions, resulting in more robust and accurate anomaly score maps [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the standard Isolation Forest algorithm suffers from an "axis-parallel" bias because its branch cuts are always horizontal or vertical, parallel to the coordinate axes [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This introduces artifacts in the anomaly score map, such as rectangular regions of incorrectly low anomaly scores, because the algorithm struggles to capture correlations between features [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) fixes this bias by generalizing the branching process. Instead of using only axis-parallel cuts, EIF allows the slicing of data to use hyperplanes with random slopes [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. At each branching point, the algorithm selects a branch cut with a random "slope" and a random intercept [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

The process for selecting these branch cuts involves two steps:
1.  A random slope is selected by choosing a normal vector, $\vec{n}$, uniformly over the unit N-Sphere. This is accomplished by drawing a random number for each coordinate of the vector from a standard normal distribution, N(0, 1) [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
2.  A random intercept, $\vec{p}$, is drawn from a uniform distribution over the range of values present at the branching point [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

This extension completely resolves the bias and artifacts seen in the standard algorithm's anomaly score heat maps [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. As a result, the artificial low-score bands are no longer present, and the score map becomes more symmetric and robust, with a much smaller variance in scores for anomalous regions [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. The EIF algorithm consistently performed better than the standard version on benchmark datasets [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the Functional Isolation Forest (FIF) algorithm projects functional data using a dictionary and scalar products through the following process:

1.  **Projection onto a Dictionary:** FIF projects functional observations onto elements of a chosen dictionary `D`. For a given function `x` and a dictionary element `d`, the projection is defined by the scalar product `(x, d)_H`. This projection creates a feature that partially describes the function `x` [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

2.  **Creating Split Variables:** The set of all possible projections onto the elements of the dictionary `D` provides a rich set of candidate "Split variables" used to represent the function's properties [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019]. The choice of a suitable dictionary is a key component in constructing the FIF anomaly score [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

3.  **Handling Multivariate Data:** The method extends to multivariate functional data. To project multivariate data, FIF uses the coordinate-wise sum of the corresponding scalar products for each of the `d` dimensions. The projection of a function `f` onto a dictionary element `g` is calculated as: `(f, g)_{H^⊗d} := ∑_{i=1}^d (f⁽ⁱ⁾, g⁽ⁱ⁾)_H` [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

The combined choice of the dictionary, the probability distribution for selecting a Split variable from it, and the scalar product for the projection gives FIF great flexibility in detecting various types of anomalies [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019]. The algorithm's inputs explicitly include a dictionary `D` and a scalar product `(·, ·)_H` for this purpose [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

Response:
Based on the provided context, Generalized Isolation Forest (GIF) improves upon Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) by eliminating the creation of empty branches, which is a drawback of EIF [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

The issue in EIF is that its intercept selection strategy can result in branches leading to empty nodes, with the probability of this occurring increasing with tree depth and data dimensionality [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. These empty branches happen when an intercept is sampled outside the convex hull of the data but inside the axis-bounding hypercube, incurring additional computational overhead [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

GIF solves this problem by changing how the separation hyperplane is selected. The process involves three steps:
1.  A random normal unit vector is selected, and all data points are projected onto it [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].
2.  The minimum and maximum values of these projections are identified [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].
3.  A split value is then sampled uniformly only within the interval between these minimum and maximum values [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

This strategy ensures that the separation hyperplane intersects the convex hull of the data, which guarantees that the data points are partitioned into two non-empty subsets [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. As a result, the probability of creating an empty branch in GIF is zero [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. This primary advantage leads to improved computational performance, making GIF faster than EIF [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

Response:
The K-Means Isolation Forest (K-Means IF) algorithm integrates K-Means clustering into its partitioning strategy to create a density-aware, multi-branching tree structure [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

The process at each node of an isolation tree is as follows:
1.  **Component Selection and Projection:** The algorithm randomly selects a single component (or attribute) and projects all data points onto it [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].
2.  **Clustering for Partitioning:** It then applies the K-Means clustering algorithm to this one-dimensional projected data to determine the partition boundaries [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
3.  **Determining Branch Count:** The optimal number of clusters, `k`, is determined using the "elbow-rule" or "elbow method." This `k` value then dictates the number of branches or child nodes for the current node [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020]. This allows the tree to have many branches, in contrast to the strictly binary splits of the standard Isolation Forest [K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].
4.  **Data Point Assignment:** Each data point is assigned to the cluster it most likely belongs to, based on its distance to the cluster's centroid. These clusters and their limits form the child nodes for the next level of the tree [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].

This method allows the tree structure to adapt to the local density of the data, as the number of branches is determined by the number of clusters found in the data at that specific node [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the Probabilistic Generalization of Isolation Forest (PGIF) uses segment-cumulated probability to generate data splits in a more meaningful way than the original Isolation Forest algorithm [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. The goal is to assign a higher probability density to sparse, out-of-cluster regions and a lower probability density to densely populated regions, or clusters [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. This is in contrast to the original method where the probability of a split depends solely on the length of a segment, making splits across wide clusters more likely [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

The PGIF method constructs a piecewise defined probability density function based on the training data. The process can be summarized as follows:

1.  **Defining Segments:** The algorithm sorts the input data and defines segments as the spaces between neighboring data points (`x_i` and `x_{i+1}`) [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].
2.  **Assigning Probability to Segments:** A probability is assigned to each segment, which is proportional to its length raised to the k-th power. The specific algorithm described involves calculating the length of each segment, raising this length to the `(k + 1)`-th power, and then normalizing these values so they sum to 1. This creates a discrete probability distribution across the segments [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].
3.  **Generating a Split Value:** To generate a split value, the algorithm first selects a segment. This is done by drawing a random number `c` from a uniform distribution between [0, 1) and then iterating through the segments until the cumulative probability is greater than `c`. Once a segment is chosen, an `invertedCumulativeProbabilityFunction` is used to find the exact split point within that selected segment [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

Mathematically, the cumulative probability function `P(x ≤ x_g)` for generating a split value `x_g` that falls within the m-th segment is defined as the sum of the probabilities of all preceding segments (`m-1`) plus the integral of the probability density function over the portion of the m-th segment up to `x_g` [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the Rényi divergence is used to define and demonstrate the properties of a generalized family of aggregation functions, `h_α`, proposed for Isolation Forests [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

The relationship is established through an intermediate function, `f_α`, which is a component of the new aggregation functions `h_α(x) = 2^{−f_α(x)}`. This `f_α` function is directly linked to the α-Rényi divergence, `R_α`, via the following identity [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023]:

`f_α(x) = exp(-R_α(\frac{x}{||x||_1} || \frac{1}{n}))`

Here, `x` is the vector of per-estimator scores and `**1**` is the vector of ones. The authors state that the properties of their proposed `f_α` functions are a "direct consequence of the properties of the Renyi divergences" [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023]. This information-theoretic connection is used to show that the aggregation functions `h_α` are monotonically increasing in the parameter `α` and interpolate between the standard Isolation Forest aggregation function and the maximum function [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

Response:
According to the provided text, applying a non-uniformly-random choice of variables and/or split thresholds can make "clustered" diverse outliers more easily identifiable [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

The paper notes that clustered outliers, which may originate from a repeated process like fraudulent activity, are often considered more "interesting" but also the most difficult to flag, particularly in datasets with multi-modal distributions. For these specific types of outliers, "non-uniformly-random splits providing an edge" in detection performance [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021]. The authors propose a non-uniform guiding heuristic that was found to offer "increased performance for the outliers of utmost interest (clustered outliers from multi-modal datasets)" [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

However, this improved performance for clustered outliers comes at a cost; the paper highlights a trade-off where these methods may have "degraded performance in other classes of outliers" [Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests, Cortes et al., 2021].

Based on the provided context, the Kernel Isolation Forest (KIFD) method is designed to analyze **hyperspectral remotely sensed images (HSIs)** for the purpose of **anomaly detection** [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

This application domain involves identifying targets that are spatially or spectrally distinct from their surrounding background in images that contain hundreds or even thousands of spectral bands.

The method was evaluated on several real hyperspectral datasets captured by sensors like the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and the Hyperspectral Digital Imagery Collection Experiment (HYDICE). These datasets included various scenes such as an airport, an urban area, an oil refinery, and a coastal area, where the anomalies to be detected were man-made objects like airplanes, cars, roofs, and storage tanks [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

Response:
The main advantage of Generalized Isolation Forest (GIF) over Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) is its improved computational performance, resulting in significantly faster execution times [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

This speed advantage is achieved by addressing a key limitation in EIF's tree-building process. EIF's method for selecting a separation hyperplane can create branches that lead to empty nodes, which incurs additional computational overhead [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. GIF overcomes this issue by selecting a hyperplane that is guaranteed to pass through the convex hull of the data. This ensures that the data is always partitioned into two non-empty subsets, thereby eliminating the creation of empty branches [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

Experiments comparing the two algorithms confirm that the time required to create the forests is "significantly smaller for GIF compared to EIF" [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021]. This advantage is attributed directly to "the absence of empty branches in the trees" [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].
