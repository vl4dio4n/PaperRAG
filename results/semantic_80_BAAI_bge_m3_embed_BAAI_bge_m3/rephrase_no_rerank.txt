Response:
Based on the provided context, the standard Isolation Forest algorithm produces several specific artifacts in its anomaly score heat maps that the Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) is designed to fix:

*   **Axis-Aligned Bands:** The standard algorithm generates rectangular bands or line patterns that are parallel to the coordinate axes [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. For a single, circular cluster of data, this results in an anomaly map shaped like a rounded square with vertical and horizontal bands of artificially low anomaly scores, creating a cross-like artifact instead of the expected circular pattern [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

*   **"Ghost" Artifacts/Clusters:** When these axis-aligned bands intersect, especially in datasets with multiple clusters, they create "ghost" regions [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. These are areas that are assigned a low anomaly score, suggesting they are normal, despite containing little or no data. This can cause an anomalous point falling in such a region to be incorrectly classified as nominal and can falsely indicate a non-existent structure in the data [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

*   **Poor Structure Detection:** For data with more complex structures, such as a sinusoidal shape, the standard algorithm fails to detect the underlying pattern. Instead, it treats the data as one large rectangular blob, again producing horizontal and vertical bands [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

These artifacts are caused by the standard Isolation Forest's branching procedure, which exclusively uses branch cuts (hyperplanes) parallel to the coordinate axes to partition the data [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. The Extended Isolation Forest remedies this by using hyperplanes with random slopes, which eliminates the bias and the resulting artificial zones of inconsistent scores [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Response:
The standard Isolation Forest algorithm suffers from an "axis-parallel" bias because its branching process splits data using hyperplanes parallel to the coordinate axes [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This method of selecting a random feature and a random value to slice the data introduces a bias based on a data point's location relative to the coordinate frame [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This bias leads to several issues:
*   It creates artifacts in anomaly score maps, such as "ghost regions" where scores are low despite a lack of data, and horizontal and vertical bands parallel to the axes [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].
*   It causes inconsistent anomaly scores, where points that are equally anomalous can receive very different scores depending on their location [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].
*   It struggles with complex data distributions, such as sinusoidal shapes, treating them as simple rectangular blobs [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].
*   It has difficulty capturing correlations between features [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) fixes these issues by generalizing the branching process [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. Instead of being restricted to axis-parallel cuts, EIF allows the data to be sliced using hyperplanes with random slopes [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This is accomplished at each branch by selecting two pieces of information: a random slope (defined by a normal vector) and a random intercept [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. The normal vector is chosen by drawing each of its components from a standard normal distribution, and the intercept is chosen from the range of available data values [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

This modification completely resolves the bias found in the standard algorithm [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. By using non-axis-parallel cuts, EIF can capture more complex dependencies in the data and eliminates the "ghost regions" and line patterns seen in standard IF score maps [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021]. This results in smoother, more robust score maps that are free of the previous artifacts and better reflect the data's underlying structure [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. EIF's improved robustness is also demonstrated by a significant reduction in the variance of anomaly scores for points along constant level sets [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Hariri et al. also proposed an alternative fix of randomly rotating the data before building each tree, which averages out the bias across the ensemble of trees. However, they identify EIF as the "preferred way" and a "much more robust fix" because it resolves the problem at its source—the branching process itself—rather than just averaging it out [Extended Isolation Forest, Hariri et al., 2021].

Response:
Functional Isolation Forest (FIF) projects functional data by using a scalar product to project observations onto elements of a chosen dictionary, which creates features that describe the data [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

The process is as follows:
*   A dictionary `D` is selected, which is a set of functions rich enough to explore different properties of the data [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].
*   To create a feature, a functional observation `x` is projected onto an element `d` from the dictionary `D`. This projection is defined by the scalar product `(x, d)_H` [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].
*   The set of these projections, when considering all functions in the dictionary, serves as a set of candidate "Split variables" that provide a rich representation of the functional data [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].
*   During the construction of a tree, a *Split variable* `d` is drawn from the dictionary, and a *Split value* is then uniformly selected from the range of values obtained by projecting the observations in the current node onto `d` [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

This methodology is also extended to multivariate functional data. In this case, the projection is calculated using the coordinate-wise sum of the scalar products for each of the `d` dimensions [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019]. The combination of the chosen dictionary and the scalar product used for projection provides the FIF algorithm with great flexibility [Functional Isolation Forest, Staerman, 2019].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the Generalized Isolation Forest (GIF) improves upon the Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) by producing trees that do not have empty branches [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

The creation of empty branches is considered a drawback of the EIF algorithm, as the sampled threshold can lead to their formation and cause a loss of information when computing the trees. GIF was specifically introduced to overcome this issue. The absence of empty branches is an advantage that helps make the GIF algorithm faster than EIF [Generalized isolation forest for anomaly detection, Lesouple et al., 2021].

Evaluation Status: ANSWERABLE

Response:
The K-Means Isolation Forest (K-Means IF) algorithm combines its partition strategy with K-Means clustering by replacing the standard binary splitting mechanism with a multi-branch, density-aware approach at each node of a decision tree [K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].

Unlike the standard Isolation Forest, which randomly selects a feature and a random split value to create two child nodes, the K-Means IF algorithm follows a different procedure for partitioning data [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020]. At each node in the tree, the K-Means IF algorithm:

1.  **Randomly selects a single component (attribute)** from the dataset [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].
2.  **Projects all data points** at that node onto the selected component [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
3.  **Applies the K-Means clustering algorithm** to the projected one-dimensional data to determine partition boundaries [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. The optimal number of clusters (`k`) is determined using the "elbow method" [K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020; Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025].
4.  **Creates `k` child nodes**, where each child node corresponds to one of the identified clusters [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025]. The clusters and their limits define the branches for that node [K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].

This method allows the tree structure to adapt to the local data density, fitting the data during the tree-building step [Extended K-Means Isolation Forest, Vlad Birsan, 2025; K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020]. The resulting tree is "wider" with potentially more than two branches at each node, which contrasts with the strictly binary trees used in the classic Isolation Forest [K-means-based isolation forest, Karczmarek et al., 2020].

Response:
The Probabilistic Generalization of Isolation Forest (PGIF) uses segment-cumulated probability to make the data splitting process more effective, aiming to perform splits between clusters rather than through them [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

The method works by assigning different probabilities to various regions of the data space. It does this by creating a piecewise defined probability density function on the segments located between neighboring points of the training data [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. The key principle is a "nonlinear dependence of segment-cumulated probability from the length of segment" [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. Specifically, the probability cumulated on a given segment is proportional to its length raised to the k-th power [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

The algorithm for generating a split point using this method is as follows:
1.  The lengths of the segments between neighboring data points are calculated [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].
2.  Each length is raised to the (k+1)-th power [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].
3.  These values are summed and then used to normalize the array, ensuring the total sum of probabilities is 1. Each element in the array now represents the cumulated probability for its corresponding segment [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].
4.  A random number is drawn from a uniform distribution, and this number is used to select a segment based on its assigned cumulated probability [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

This approach assigns a lower probability density to densely populated regions (clusters) and a higher probability density to out-of-cluster regions, such as the gaps between clusters or between a cluster and an outlier [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. By increasing the probability of a split occurring in these sparser gaps, outliers are more likely to be isolated in the earlier stages of building a tree, resulting in a higher anomaly score [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022]. This contrasts with the original Isolation Forest, where the uniform distribution of split point generation makes it more likely for splits to occur across wide clusters rather than in the relatively narrower inter-cluster gaps [A probabilistic generalization of isolation forest, Tokovarov,, 2022].

Response:
Based on the provided context, the family of aggregation functions, `h_α`, is linked to the α-Rényi divergence from information theory through the function `f_α(x)` [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023]. The aggregation functions are defined as `h_α(x) = 2^(−f_α(x))` [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

The direct mathematical relationship is given by the identity:

`f_α(x) = exp(-R_α(x/||x||_1 || 1/n))`

In this formula, `R_α` is the α-Rényi divergence, `x` is the vector of per-estimator scores, and **1** is the vector of ones. The properties claimed for the `f_α` functions are a "direct consequence of the properties of the Renyi divergences" [Distribution and volume based scoring for Isolation Forests, Dhouib et al., 2023].

Response:
According to the 'Revisiting randomized choices in isolation forests' paper, applying a non-uniformly-random choice of variables or split thresholds can make "clustered" diverse outliers easier to identify [Cortes et al., 2021].

The paper states that for clustered outliers from multimodal datasets, which are often the most interesting but hardest to flag, "non-uniformly-random splits providing an edge" [Cortes et al., 2021]. The authors propose a specific guiding heuristic called Fair-Cut Forest (FCF), which was found to offer increased performance for these clustered outliers. This is because its split criterion produces more "natural separations," which is especially useful in clustered or multimodal distributions [Cortes et al., 2021]. However, this improved performance for clustered outliers comes at the cost of "degraded performance in other classes of outliers" [Cortes et al., 2021].

Other methods with non-uniform splits are also discussed. For instance, SCIFOREST uses a deterministic criterion for its split threshold to make each tree branch more homogeneous, which also aims to improve detection in typical anomaly detection datasets [Cortes et al., 2021].

Based on the provided context, the Kernel Isolation Forest (KIFD) method is designed for **hyperspectral anomaly detection** [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

The specific type of images analyzed are **hyperspectral remotely sensed images (HSIs)**, which contain hundreds or thousands of spectral bands. The goal of this application is to distinguish interesting targets, or anomalies, that are spatially or spectrally different from their surrounding background without any prior knowledge of the target's spectral signature [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].

The method was evaluated on several real-world hyperspectral data sets, including:
*   An airport area in San Diego, where the anomalies were three airplanes [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].
*   An urban area (HYDICE data set), where anomalies were man-made objects like cars and roofs [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].
*   An oil refinery (El Segundo data set), where storage tanks and towers were considered anomalies [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].
*   A coastal location on the Gulf Coast (Grand Isle data set), where man-made objects in the water were the anomalies [Hyperspectral anomaly detection with kernel isolation forest, Li et al., 2019].
